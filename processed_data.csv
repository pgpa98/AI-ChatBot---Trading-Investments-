Stock market,investing,The stock market is a total joke…,"up  yesterday down  this morning how does any of this make any sense anymore 

can anyone explain these wide market swings at this point theyre starting to seem arbitrary to me but then again im just a passive trader trying to scrape together enough to maybe retire one day what do i know

edit i should clarify that iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been casually invested since  and do have a bit of knowledge about the markets historical volatility my post is mostly just venting 

but whats really been confusing me are the extremes of the markets swings this year as compared to others it is not normal or typical market behavior to have a record increase one day immediately followed by a record decrease the next day the current labor climate and supply chain issues have been ongoing for more than a year so that shouldnt be new news to investors 

as a long term investor ill continue to buy and weather the storm but again my point is that as i understand it the volatility over the past year is historically anomalous and i was curious if anyone could put it into perspective for me",1545,"can anyone explain these wide market swings

Stock market,investing,Russian Stock Market to Partially Reopen on Thursday,"russias stock market is set to have a partial reopening thursday nearly a month after it shut down following the invasion of ukraine 
the challenge for moscow is that the resumption of trading could simply send russian stocks back into free fall on feb  the day when president vladimir putin began the assault on ukraine the main russian stock index tumbled  while the index regained a fraction of those losses on feb its last day of tradingthat was before western sanctions hammered the ruble and sent the country into an economic crisis

to limit the fallout moscow has turned to some heavyhanded policies it blocked foreign investors from dumping local stocksa move that some market participants saw as retaliation for a western freeze on russian central bank assets since a big chunk of the russian market is owned by foreigners the russian government ordered its main sovereignwealth fund to buy billions of dollars worth of shares 

the russian stock market could ultimately look very different than it did before with a plan under discussion to split it into separate markets for foreign and local investors according to a person familiar with the matter

russias central bank said wednesday that it will allow trading of  shares out of  included in the benchmark stock index the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) on thursday from  am to  pm moscow time among the companies to be traded are gazprom pjsc and lukoil pjsc bets on the fall of a stock known as shortselling will be banned

under a policy announced by the central bank on feb  russian brokerages arent allowed to let foreign clients sell securities this will prevent foreigners from bolting for the exits as soon as the market reopens which could be ruinous because of their outsize role in russian stocks international institutional investors held about threequarters of the russian markets free float as of february  according to sberbank investment research

that has raised concerns that the market will be skewed by the absence of foreign investors who accounted for nearly half of equities trading volume at the moscow exchange in the first half of last year
there will be an illusion of a working recovering russian stock market even though a huge class of players in the marketforeignerswont have the opportunity to sell said vladimir kreyndel CNOOC Limited (CEO) of etf consulting a moscow firm that advises issuers of exchangetraded funds 

among the western investors that held russian stocks before the freeze were assetmanagement giants vanguard group and fidelity international both firms have said they are reducing exposure to russia
due to the freeze foreign investors wont have much to do when the stock market reopens 

but the plan under consideration by russian officialswhich is still in the discussion stageswould effectively split the countrys securities market in two with one market for foreigners and another for local investors the person familiar with the matter said in this arrangement foreign investors could sell their shares or bonds but would face restrictions on moving the proceeds out of russia because of capital controls that moscow has imposed since february the person said

such a bifurcated market could result in oddities such as the same stock having two different prices that isnt completely unprecedented in china there have long been discrepancies between shares on mainland exchanges in shanghai and shenzhen and those listed in hong kong
it could also prevent further erosion of the rubles value russias currency has stabilized in recent sessions to trade near  rubles to the dollar though it remains  weaker than before russia invaded ukraine

the biggest fear is that the central bank is under sanctions and they dont want foreign investors to sell their shares and take the ruble and buy hard currency said jacob grapengiesser head of eastern europe at emerging markets fund manager east capital

the moscow exchange said monday that it would allow for the settlement of trades that foreign investors had placed before feb  that were still being processed mr grapengiesser said his firm had trades still awaiting settlement from the start of the war that he expects to go through soon 

its a natural step before opening the market you need to take care of those unsettled trades he said things are slowly moving forward
shortly after the war began russias prime minister ordered the countrys national wealth fund to buy up to one trillion rubles equivalent to  billion worth of shares this year analysts also expect some russian oil companies to prop up their share prices with buyback programs

local investors may buy stocks too when russia invaded crimea the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) fell almost  between midfebruary and midmarch of  but by the end of that year it had rebounded more than  from that march low the broad index has posted gains in all but one year since  stocks in unstable countries can also serve as hedges against inflation because locals expect companies can offset rising costs by charging higher prices

the governments efforts have led some to be cautiously optimistic about the reopening initially i think there will be a moderate correction said natalia smirnova a financial adviser in moscow but i wouldnt rule out the possibility that the first day could end up with a modest increase

russia is a minnow of a financial market by global terms in december  the total market capitalization of companies listed on the moscow exchange was about  billion according to the world federation of exchanges which is just under  of the current value of tesla Suncor Energy (Inc.)that made the moscow exchange the th largest bourse by market cap just above brazils b exchange in the wfes ranking of global exchanges

until the war russia mostly attracted attention from specialist emergingmarket funds and hedge funds though it made up only a fraction of holdings for most globally minded investors 

msci Suncor Energy (Inc.)said it would drop russian stocks from its influential indexes that track emerging markets before the war mscis emerging market index had a  weighting for russia ftse russell has also announced plans to remove russian stocks from its indexes the moves will force investors whose holdings track the indexes to sellwhen they can 
wars have led to stockmarket shutdowns before although it is unusual the new york stock exchange closed for about four months when world war i broke out in  the longest closure in the nyses history the beirut stock exchange reopened in  after a nearly year shutdown caused by lebanons civil war",1074,deleted,for anyone thinking to buy the dip my parents still have state obligations from  to sell you,im curious if finra will remove the trading halt on russian adrs they are currently halted under a code related to the exchange being closed but the halt may persist with sanctions

Stock market,investing,Stock Market = Compound Interest? How?,iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) heard people say invest in the stock market for retirement and use compound interest to grow your wealth and similar right but if a vast majority of the growth is capital growth and not from divint or realized capital gains how is that compounding or do they mean because you keep investing that that is the compounding part,32,"compound returns not compound interest

xb

you buy a share of Vanguard Total Stock Market VIPERs (VTI) for  if it increases yr thats the average return on the total market then its worth  after a year another  and its  another year and its  another year and its  after five years it would be 

xb

so you made  on  in the first year but you made  in the fifth year thats because youre earning the same yr but youre earning it on the original investment and everything youve gained up to that point that is compounding

xb

obviously the market doesnt go up in a straight line at a steady yr but that gives you an illustration of how it works","stocks dont benefit from compound interest interest is earned by bondsdebt

stocks benefit from compounding returns because the earnings that are generated in a given year are reinvested into the business increasing the earnings that are made in the next year which can then be reinvested again back into the business and grow future earnings even faster and so on","compounding is the th wonder of the world time is you best friend and never interrupting the compound

start early put in what you can and just forgot about the money come back    years later and be amazed buy a quality etf like the sp dont trade individual stocks 

use a compound interest calculator and play around with time annual additions return rate etc and its pretty amazing what a couple extra years can do for your money the one below is very easy to use and under stand 



another quick thing is the rule of  divide  by and interest rate and that is roughly how many years it will take to double divide  by the number of years you want to double you money and that is the rate of return you need 

getting wealthy is a slow and steady game and its very hard to beat time and compounding"
Stock market,investing,Why not just take the guaranteed 5% on High Yield Savings or T-Bills over the stock market?,"recently i had someone review my portfolio free work benefit to have a financial advisor with brightplan i have about  in stockkira but lately my other  has been going to a high yield savings account which currently gets me  with the bonus  

he was saying for my age thats too risk averse and that even  is under the annual return from the stock market but from my point of view i get a guaranteed  that compounds monthly why wouldnt i take that over the stock market at the moment",345,"it is all a choice and neither is right or wrong for everyone

but depending on your age and time horizon a relatively riskacceptable approach of the sp averages far more than  over a long time that adds up significantly 

by trying to time the market you tend to miss the best days 

i will leave this here for some fun reading for an adjacent discussion",because of days like today equities are where you make real money but you got to stay invested,"the guaranteed fixed income is great for older people nearing retirement or people planning to make a big purchase home etc 

but you gotta remember the market averages  over the long term its not a guaranteed  every year so by locking in that  you could be missing out on so much more 

perfect example is this year Vanguard Total Stock Market VIPERs (VTI) is up  ytd also all the market gains this year have come on like  days so yes youve gotten risk free  but missed  growth not adjusted for inflation"

Trading strategy,investing,"My trading strategy..,this is what works for me.","about me

a former longtime investment adviser who is a very active trader iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) also worked in private equity for several years

im here to share my strategy on trading and significantly increasing overall income

i have rules that i trade by they work for me theyre guidelines they may or may not be for you

i will share my trades and results i will not discuss or offer opinions on the fundamentals of a company im happy to comment if asked as to what trade i would enter on a company i am not licensed to give advice

what i do is rather simple  yet most advisersinvestors know nothing about it 

its called coveredcall writing im sure many here have heard of it or used this strategy there are various ways to implement using covered calls  i keep it as simple as possible

essentially  you are buying a stock then selling the right to have the shares taken away from you at a particular price on a specific date for selling that right  you receive a premium income

my personal trading rules

  invest in companies you know and want to be invested in quality companies

   diversify industries bankssteeltransportationtechpharma etc

  hedge i keep at least one precious metal company in my portfolio at all times

  keep your emotions in check the market is fluid you will be right you will be wrong dont chase a stock in any direction

  use income to average down if you are invested in several companies not all will move in tandem take some of the income youve generated to average down

  sell the call option right after the purchase of shares or previous option expiry

  if you use margin  only use half of what youre allowed to use none if you dont understand the risks

  stay shortterm the call options i sell are typically  to  weeks out i can always by back shares if theyre taken away

  be patient dont stare at your screen all day unless this is your career

  try to have an options expiring every week generate income weekly

i will put up a couple examples as well",97,"invest in companies you know and want to be invested in quality companies 

thank you for making this rule  where iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) gone wrong with covered calls in the past has been to chase yield rather than trading companies i actually wanted to own kids learn from my mistakes",you didnt mention how you choose the strike price isnt that a fairly important part of covered calls,"this guy probably wasnt a very good investment advisor the income is already accounted for in the premiums and the risk that you are taking in the long run theoretically you would break even with this strategy if you were to just buy and hold except for the fact that covered call premium will typically be taxed at a higher rate than long term gains 

this isnt some secret cheat code for investing the risks and the premium are priced in 

if you really want to sell covered calls heres a potentially better strategy buy etfs with deep options chains sell monthly covered calls about  out of the money during times of high volatility youll still capture about  of the upside while generating bps per month in premium meanwhile etfs allow you to stay diversified spy MidCap SPDR Trust Series I (MDY) iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund (IWM) iShares MSCI EAFE Index Fund (EFA) iShares MSCI Emerging Index Fund (EEM) iShares Lehman Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG)"

methodology

the program begins by back testing a predefined set of tickers sp in this case using the buy and sell signals listed above in order to reduce biased results i walk through the time period that is i fed the program a single day at a time each day i calculated buy signals and if the conditions were met id purchase the security hold it and continue to cycle through each proceeding day and calculated sell signals
once the security was bought and sold id write down the trade and move onto the next day the end result was a list of every single trade that could have potentially occurred in the predefined date range with the predefined list of tickers

id sort these entries by purchase date in ascending order oldest first and every trade that fell on the same day was put into a list and archived in a dictionary with keyword purchasedate the result was a data structure i could query and pull a list of all trades that could have occurred on a specified date

i then had all the information i needed to begin the actual back test i began with the first possible purchase date searched the dictionary to obtain a list of all possible trades that could have occurred on that day chose one at random wrote down the trades information and moved onto the next available purchase date

once all dates were exhausted i calculated an annual return by finding the product of all the years trades i did this  times in order to obtain the average and standard deviation of annual returns since my data didnt tell me which trade occurred when it was impossible for me to define the exact sequence of trades my idea was if i got enough random trade sequences i could create a universe of possible scenarios with the most likely being the most prevalent  it was a way for me to calculate a return and cover all my bases at the same time",219,you know i backtested hundreds of moving averages holding period dates crossovers technical signals and many various combinations  i even tried various backtests with quantifiable macro numbers like monthly ism and even with fundamentals likes pes  iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) backtested a lot of these and found returns above that of an index  when i implemented these systems however they do not work  i was curve fitting and data mining  i suspect you will find the same conclusion,great work what program do you use,"i own a quant trading shop and i tested this out in my simulation system for fun  i expanded the universe and did some basic screening to filter out stocks that arent liquid or easily executed  i bought k per position round lots so youd need about  million to run this at that level assuming my liquid universe

this indicator seemed to have worked ok until fall  but hasnt worked since  a  million investment in spy would have been more profitable over the past  years"

so i have  stocks i like in a particular sector that have been following for a couple years very close in price with minor variability talking about usually  cents in difference in extremes

instead of timing price i like to sell a majority of one stock at the higher price and buy the lower price stock for a few cents cheaper per share this results in increasing total number of shares of stock  then the lower priced stock will rise to within one or two cents or higher priced stock sometimes surpass it i will then liquidate shares back into the other stock and rinse and repeat

focused on two penny stocks in the energy sector but i wonder if this is a common strategy with blue chip stocks and if so which ones",1,"i sometimes will hear the term correlated pairs trade when discussing this sort of strategy

if you are trading different issues from the same issuer for example trading a preferred against a common from the same company that could be described as an arbitrage",this is pairs or spread trading a type of stat Arbitron Inc.

is it fun oh yes it is tremendously exciting and rewarding basic strategy is literally buy low average down when it falls and sell when it spikes 

easy to say but in practice you really have to accept that for  days it will trend down then something like the bank debacle happens and it saves your ass

it is gambling pure and simple but am up  this year on simple  share buys at a time  i have a large cash account then sell when i hit a daily profit of 

today i made k riding it from  to  it is sooo fun when it spikes something about making money when everybody else is losing money tickles the senses and it happens so fast

i dont trade futures but i have considered trading options on es and rty futures instead of spx or rut but with futures you have to also deal with contango and backwardation and the strategies can get more interestingcomplex 

as for leverage  leverage on futures can be higher since margin is calculated differently using span but with options if you are trading from a portfolio margin not to be confused with regt margin account you may get similar amount of leverage 

as for losing more than   it depends on the strategies being employed for a trader that is writing option contracts you can lose more than the initial value of the contract for an option buyer your max loss is limited to the value of the contracts when the position is opened so for options the risk characteristics are dependent on the strategies being employed","please stay away from futures if your asking these questions

a future contract is exactly that you promise to buy or sell the underlying at that price an option contract owner has the option to choose if heshe wants to exercise or not in an future contract both sides must fulfill their contractual obligation to buy or to sell

for example es emini future on sp  is around  points right now every  point is  if sp tanks to  its a x k loss or win depending if long or short

also if it rips to  its a x  k move

if you owned the option you paid the premium to choose if you want to exercise or not if you buy a call and the underlying tanks you just loose your premium if you buy a future contract and the underlying tanks you have to pay up there is no choice remember"

Options trading,investing,Options/Trading 104: Mechanics of buying options,"recommended reading









this really should be a  level since it involves some numbers although you wont yet need a calculator but ill just keep the numbering sequential for ocd sake  on that note im aiming this at people who read and understood the first two  which were brief but dense  also were getting to the point where i cant generalize options as much so note that this post and probably the rest is geared more towards trading options as opposed to things like hedging or using as synthetic instruments  as usual corrections are welcome


disclaimer i am writing this as an educational supplement  my motivation for writing these has been explicitly to help fill the gap in more advanced conversations  by no means am i encouraging anyone to trade with this information  its worth pointing out that in efforts to make these short and productive iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) trimmed out the potentially ridiculous risk with options  perhaps ill dedicate an entire post for that







exchange

quick note on this  unlike stocks which are listed in specific exchanges like National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) or New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) stock options are not bound to a particular exchange since theyre essentially just bets  its worth knowing that the chicago board options exchange or cboe is the biggest among them theres like  or so 
other ones and is home to the all popular vix more on this at a later date  but to make things simple when picking an exchange theres usually a  choice which figures it out for you





the market

so its finally time to pick some options  well just like stocks the first stop is to check out the prices  but now were going to pay special attention to the market as well because although market conditions play a part in stocks they play a crucial role with options  also if youre speculating on a price move the trick is to shop around for opportunities involving various strategies using options andor stocks because there are many ways to bet  many more than just up or down that is  

while looking at buying options a good rule of thumb is to make sure theres healthy a lot of volume  having a liquid market will make sure that theres enough buyers and sellers to get in and back out of the position with relative ease  its entirely possible that you buy an option and then have nobody to sell it back to at a halfway reasonable price when the time is right  

this also tends to tighten up the bidask spread remember bid is sell price ask is buy price  this is another big difference with options  typically when buying stocks as long as theyre somewhat popular i dont even look at the spread  in fact most popular stock quoters wont even show them  but youll notice that options chains rarely have a single price and instead show you the bidask separately  the reason for this is that with options pennies matter  and the spread will consume into your profits  

take a look at this  with march expiration  youll see that there are some options with  cent spread green and others with  cent spreads red  if you were to buy options from the red circle youre instantly losing  dollars per contract not to mention commissions  i just checked some Apple Computer, Inc. (AAPL) jan  calls and some of them have like a  spread  thats  per contract instantly evaporated

the  factors i can think of that determine liquidity are option popularity some stocks dont attract options traders and strike price  expiration date  even popular stocks lose volume if you look to far ahead or if you pick strike prices that are far from the money  

make that   open interest or Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) or original poster int  this is a metric that youll typically see in options chains indicating the number of live contracts which are out on the market high Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) would imply that theres high volume the reason why volume and Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) are not necessarily the same is because in practice you can write a contract create a new one and adding  to the Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) tally and later buy it back subtracting  to Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) tally  if this scenario played out in an empty market the volume would be  and Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) would be 






timing

timing is everything with options  remember that the moment you buy an option it starts losing extrinsic value from time decay so this is important  as noted by  in the last post time decay is not linear  meaning that stocks wont lose a set amount every day until expiration  


 showing what the time decay looks like as dictated by the  model  youll notice the drop in price due to time decay exponentially increases at  days from expiration  this doesnt mean options with less than  days are no good but if you buy them it should be part of your strategy like say a day trade


another important thing to consider is recent news with the underlying stock  big events can temporarily dislodge prices which you can also use in your favor if you want  announced dividends is a big one  for various reasons on an exdividend date call prices will go down and put prices will go up  another big one is earnings releases  youll notice a huge buildup in premiums due to implied volatility as an earnings release approaches and then a huge drop the day after  this affects calls and puts alike  





edit strike price

credit to  for bringing this up


additional observation from  who points out that this point becomes gray area when the strike and underlying price are close

another important thing to remember is the dangers of buying options with no intrinsic value because after all when the expiration day comes thats all theyre worth  so buying an option with no intrinsic value not itm has the potential to be worthless upon expiration  

that said theyre not always bad depending on your strategy  for example buying an otm option is sort of like buying a house with a  interest mortgage your monthly mortgage payments only go towards the interest but not towards the principal of the house  some people actually do this because they believe the value of the house will go up and theyll resell it for profit





leverage

this is a very important concept which early options traders dont realize right away and is the reason options can be so powerful andor dangerous

options harness the power of leverage by relying on changes in price to derive their values and not necessarily the price of the underlying  for example lets compare McDonald's Corporation (MCD) and grpn currently trading at  and  respectively  if you look at their march expirations options youll see that the price for an atthemoney call strike prices  and  is about  for each of them  and yes i realize McDonald's Corporation (MCD) is not quite  yet but if you factor out intrinsic and extrinsic values youll end up about the same

so for  you can buy a call which expires next month for either of these two companies and youve exposed yourself to  shares of said company 

now ceteris paribus if the price of both grpn and McDonald's Corporation (MCD) went up tomorrow by  the price of the McDonald's Corporation (MCD) call would go up to around  while the price of grpns call would go up to around   thats the difference between profiting  vs   

and the reason for this is because if McDonald's Corporation (MCD) went up by  it would be up  and if grpn went up by  it would only be up by  and the premium only cares about relative price movement and not necessarily about the underlyings value this is a simplification

this is also why expensive stocks like Apple Computer, Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) are popular with options gamblers because as youve already seen here they can have huge swings  and this is also how a lot of people go broke


i realize i sped through this topic  if it left you confused ask and ill either reply or modify the post






the chain


and finally the chain  this is just to tie up some of these concepts and you can see what they look like in the real world  at first it can be overwhelming when looking at options chains but if you know what youre looking for theyre not that bad  im going to show you what it looks like in optionshouse but most chains will be similar in nature and information




 purple circles  calls and related metrics bid price ask price volume and open interest

 blue circles  puts and related metrics bid price ask price volume and open interest

 green circles  expiration date

 cyan circles  strike prices

 yellow circles  options that are at or very near the money

the other numbers are for a later day

also to highlight the risks involved go back and look at the february expiration contracts still open under Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) both calls and puts which are expiring worthless tomorrow  if you go back and look at marchs prices youll pretty much get an idea of what those contracts were worth a month ago  thats a lot of money lost


continued reading",102,jartek im going to thank you each time you write one of these thank you i just found out i have to have an entire book read for class on wednesday so im off to barnes and nobles to buy it and read it cant wait to get to this later tonight,clear and easy to digest awesome,"unlike stocks which are listed in specific exchanges like National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) or New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) stock options are not bound to a particular exchange since theyre essentially just bets 

  actually they are bound to particular exchanges similar to stock only that they dont have a primary listing of course this doesnt really mean anything significant that i can think of since probably anyone reading this  will be using a smart router and not directing their order to a particular exchange

 another important thing to remember is the dangers of buying options with no intrinsic value because after all when the expiration day comes thats all theyre worth

  thats a little bit misleading because only as we get very close to expiration do we know who is in the money in other words you could argue that it is more risky to buy a slightly in the money option than a slightly out of the money option because now you are risking the intrinsic value as well"

hft and trading bots absolutely have not made fundamental analysis or value investment obsolete market makers which are the largest chunk of the  figure youve quoted have no clue about whether the stock price will go up or down over a hour time span but they have a good idea over a  second time span they equally trade both sides of the market fundamental analysis and value investing targets a time range of days to months they are not impacted much by hfts 


on the other hand trading bots have made day trading obsolete this is the activity you should not engage in 


case in point our company has been in hft since the start and is now starting a fundamental investment vehicle for the companys own profits thus showing that we believe its not at all obsolete","trading bots are why you should not day trade the bots are trained to detect and arbitrage residual patterns and shortterm inefficiencies in the ideal world the bots would just flatten out the volatilities ie inefficiencies but often the bots also contribute to the volatility

because most bots dont care about fundamentals it is precisely this fundamental information that will give you an edge over the bots over the long term

so why dont the bots use fundamental analysis automatic trading based on fundamental knowledge is hard because fundamental analysis is difficult to do properly theoretically discounted cash flow analysis should be the only tool you use given an accurate record of core earnings and accurate projections into the future however the future projects are difficult to determine and you are also estimating an absolute valuation of the company if you make a mistake anywhere or make a bad assumption which is very likely your estimate could be way off

you can also do relative valuation of a company by comparing a multiple of the stock against the multiples of comparable stocks peers however in this relative valuation you are assuming that the prices of the peers are correct this then leads to a conundrum if you are assuming that the prices of the peers are correct why would you assume that the price of the stock you are analyzing is wrong"

Fundamental analysis,investing,Technical and Fundamental Analysis,"iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) done some searching and cant find what i am looking for any suggestions on how to learn about technical analysis and fundamental analysis i prefer books to videos but ultimately just want the best resource

thanks",15,"technical analysis is based on the fact that buyingselling happens in predictable ways  when you combine the notions of momentum with supportresistance you can accurately predict price movement based on buying and selling  this is the hardest part for people to accept that you can predict price movement  however once you get good at it you become amazed that such a thing is possible


for example if i told you that gold is going to  most people in here would laugh at me  however when you see that price print you will no longer be laughing

the reason why people using technical analysis reject fundamental analysis is because all the pieces of the fundamental puzzle are missing for the average retail investor  


you cannot possibly account for all fundamental factors when determining fair market value of a security currency influence inflationdeflation news insider trading etc etc


as to which is better just know this  tons of people make and lose money using both technical and fundamental analysis  those that fail at one tend to badmouth it because they gave up


as for me i was using fundamental analysis but switched to purely technical and am not looking back  it is x easier to see the charts for what they really are  only the result of buying and selling


now im not saying that there arent fundamental reasons why a price goes up and down  however i am saying that you dont have to know the fundamental reason why",technical analysis is selffulfilling sometimes  if everyone trades on the same technical rules then the patterns form themselves,"maybe im a dipshit but im just some guy on the internet and can say whatever fuck i want so 

unless you are playing around with money that you can lose and you have loads of time on your hands dont get caught up in fundamental vs technical technical by the way is bs you will lose your money eventually fundamental is also very hard because you are usually looking at information that has already been accounted for by the market makers 

instead learn diversified index investing and make that the majority of portfolio set aside  of your portfolio for speculation pick outoffavor stocks or sectors that you think may rebound hold for a year minimum catch the upswing if not sell and write off the loss"
Fundamental analysis,investing,"So how simple is fundamental analysis, really?","believe me when i say that im trying to make this as simple as possible because investing is complicated already if im looking at a companys book value shareholder equity and im trying to see if its bigger than the current market cap do i just literally look at one and then look at the other to see the difference do i have to crank out an equation to see if one equals the other or is it as simple as just keeping your eyes a little bit more open

yes trying to figure how exactly how much a security is undervalued or overvalued is the goal and none of the analytical work can really be backchecked you really have to trust what you know and thats a problem when you have zero background in this stuff and zero business experience at all but how much simpler can you really make this without losing something substantial in the analytical process",166,"just keep reading keep learning and keep practicing  if your brokerage account has access to research reports like cfra or morningstar read those but take them with a grain of salt  look up some simple valuation techniques to get started  the  also known as the gordon growth model is super simple to use and will give you a feel for valuing a business  its limited in a few ways for example its only good for companies that pay a consistent or growing dividend good news is thats a lot of them but you can build from there 

as youre doing this put some money on the line  buy and hold and then reflect on how your investment did   what did you think the value was at the time how has it done since how might it keep doing in the future  repeat  buy something else  curious how oil and gas companies work  do some research and buy one and then see how your research plays out with real money on the line  or how about banks  does reality match your expectations after you bought

really have fun with it  i like doing fundamental analysis and buying individual stocks because its engaging for me keeps me entertained and theres always more to learn",youre talking about price to book which is one of about  ratios that people use to analyze stocks  yes this is easy to calculate but isnt enough information to tell you if the stock is a good investment or not  aside from this and all other quantitative measures are the qualitative aspects such as strength of the companys brand competitive position quality of management etc which are subjective and difficult to assess and analyze unless you have background and experience in business and investing,"as with most anything in finance the calculations arent very complex even a complex  statement dcf model in excel uses mostly simple arithmetic its understanding the implicit assumptions and this is where it becomes more of an art than science 

if you find out the book value is greater than the market value then thats the beginning you dont know any more than anyone else at this point there are people being paid tons of money to find undervalued stocks and they have automated those types of calculations

you need to understand why the market value is less than the book value what are the implicit assumptions being made on that stock that would be causing it to be valued below book do you agree with those assumptions will the market ever figure it out will there be some sort of catalyst to move the stock in the direction you think how will the company realize the value what are the downside risks if the company doesnt realize it does the upside outweigh the downside"

Technical analysis,investing,Why I am bearish on BB (technical analysis),"im a software eng and therefore will only cover the technical aspects as you might already see in the title im bearish on bb i decided to share my thoughts since a lot of people and analysts seem to overvalue the potential growth of the stocki want to give a quick and very abstract introduction on technical terms

 technicalities

bbs qnx is a commercial unixlike operating system aimed primarily at the embedded systems market in other words qnx can be run as a base on probably everything that is considered a computer  since its unixlike nature  it powers train controls ventilators automation systems etc

why would someone use qnx according to bb because it is  secure scalable and reliable focusing on cars because thats what everyone talks about in this context especially after the aws news a car manufacturer could implement qnx as the os and on top of that develop everything else  for example the gui an appstore etc

however some in fact most of the biggest car manufacturers already developed or about to develop their own os why only they know 

 contra bb qnx

the following car manufacturers are 

 toyota
 vw
 daimler
 ford
 honda
 bmw
 General Motors Corporation (GM)

xb

  for  linux
  and develops  linux which will be implemented across all volkswagens audis and porsches other car manufacturers which are part of the vw group that is skoda seat lamborghini bugatti skania man etc are not confirmed so far but im sure they will follow
 daimler ditched qnx for  linux although the t every new mercedes build since  comes with mbux instead of qnx
  and will use googles  instead
 honda seems to stay with qnx
  and uses idrive linux although it seems that qnx is still working under the hood
  a few years ago and uses just like ford android

i didnt research the other car manufacturers because the trend seems clear to me feel free to research them and let me know what you come up with for anyone curious about tesla 

 pro bb qnx

developing an  especially security compliance is a huge deal

 conclusion

in my opinion bb is overhyped qnx is being ditched by pretty much most of the car manufacturers and the trend in the car industry 

furthermore i just searched through job listings for qnx and found only  positions across germany and the only car manufacturer out of that pool being daimler still need to maintain older cars that run qnx i suppose

although volkswagen had problems in the past when developing vwos other manufactures such as daimler did excellent and mbux is regarded as the best infotainment system there is as of right now

i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please  if you have any questions or concerns","this E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) sucks because it is so narrowly focused on qnx qnx is not bbs main offering  look at the company from a complete perspective 

i dont even think you fully understand from a technical point what qnx does or how it fits in the tech stack there is an entire qnx stack that covers everything from security to entertainment   oems are using qnx and the number is only increasing with iot expanding android auto is literally built along with qnx car companies are coming out with their own ui  entertainment systems that run on top of qnx

when it comes to the Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) play bb ivy  qnx will be dominant players in the industry because of the security they provide understand that cars are basically becoming computers with wheels that is a dangerous because someone can hack a car and fuck shit up they could run it into a group of people or load it with explosives are have it auto drive into a building   people are giving a lot of weight to qnx due to the Eaton Vance Corporation (EV)  iot play but they need to understand that this isnt the only reason to buy bb

i think you and a lot of people are looking at this the wrong way you really need to understand that bb is now a cyber security company first the security standard for bb is the highest in the industry and it is no joke there is a reason the g countries have contracts with bb this oems still has a lot of power in the industry and you guy are forgetting that bb was and still is an og player in the industry  here are all productsservices that bb is offering besides

qnx embedded system os

 multios housing it has the capability to allow for multiple oss on a single chip
 realtime availabilitysoftware prioritization not all pieces of software operate on the same priority steeringbraking would be higher priority than media and qnx allows for that even if the threadcore is shared with other applications when high priority software is requesting a resource it will be prioritized to ensure reliability
 resource sharing cpu ram and gpu resource sharing between different applications capability two applications can share the same cpu core and bump each other based on prioritization
 why not linux qnx has the highest certification for security available linux does not ceos would want to avoid liability and this certification allows for that
 device agnostic it can be installed on any device not just cars any iot and offline device can use qnx

qnx hypervisor consolidate multiple oss on a single soc using virtualization

 soc system on a chip instead of using multiple ecus which is what car manufacturers currently do they can use one single chip to run multiple high priority applications and multiple oss this is what tesla does now
 virtualization running an os in a virtual environment think linux environment inside of windows this helps with debugging for developers without having to have the actual hardware

ivy scalable cloudconnected software platform for vehicles

 what is it a solution for when a vehicle manufacturer wants a way to transmit the qnxos data safely normalize it and visualize itinteract with it it also allows car manufacturers to own the data unlike other oss
 scalable aws servers are capable of handling the load from many endpoints
 software platform there is currently no centralized software ecosystem for vehicles ivy is providing that
 nonbb developers would be able to use an sdk to develop applications on ivy for infotainmentgeneral appsothers ivy will also use ml to gain insight on unrecognized patterns by developers an example of this is detecting if a car slipped without having the developer connect multiple sensors to figure out if that event happened
  joint effort on revenue and effort to develop the ecosystem using awss knowledge in aiml for calculated sensors slip driver on seat etc
 usage by other vendors a city can connect to the data from vehicles and detect when iceslipping is happening if brakes are getting overheated coming from a high elevation area if a car had an accident etc an insurance company can provide an app to give discounts similar to the currently implemented obd readers a maintenance provider can also connect to this data and check if an error is specific to maintenance malpractice or general misuse

than you got patents majorhuge lawsuits won acquiring other security companies decent leadership getting out of mobile pivoting to focus in software decent cash inflow etci hope bb will close around  by the end of the year just need a few catalysts i think the rocket is being built right now and will blast off as soon as we get some fuel

Technical analysis,investing,Controversial opinion: Technical analysis is just astrology,"iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) tried to learn technical analysis and the different patterns of stock charts theres obviously thousands of courses and online videos about this sort of thing but it seems that almost none of these patterns can be used sustainably over long periods of time as external news events always triumph over any chart reading 

the conclusion i have come to is that technical analysis is no different than astrology its much better to look at the fundamentals of a business and its growth potential than to try and guess the next stock price based on some lines on a chart 

the only question i have is why do so many people try to use it and why are there so many fake youtubers and scammers who try to sell you on this stuff",2653,"the only question i have is why do so many people try to use it and why  
 are there so many fake youtubers and scammers who try to sell you on   
this stuff

my theory is they are selling a dream i mean how awesome would it be to look at a few stocks draw some lines and day trade work from anywhere with an internet connection  be your own boss and rake in a lot of money

plus drawing lines on a graph is fun it beats fundamental analysis  what is pouring over numbers doing dfc analysis and wacc calculations pouring over financial statements   also studying the industry to get a firm understanding of the industry  then investing and hoping you make a few extra percentage points then the sp index  and it taking years to pay off that shit is hard complicated  requires math and basic finance skills

also realize lets just say in theory i found some signal through charting that could be exploited  i would either

a not tell anyone about it and exploit itonce you tell people about it  it becomes a race and is no longer exploitable

b try to sell it to some propitiatory trading firm for millions of dollars

i wouldnt sell it to random people for  bucks a pop","this isnt controversial in the industry laugh out loud at least the way retailers do technical analysis 

actual real analysis of technicals done by algorithms written by people with phds does happen

but when some smoothbrain draws lines on a chart and pretends it means something no it shouldnt be controversial to call them out on it

youll note that people who peddle this crap arent actually doing technical analysis they arent defining things in a technical way a channel is never defined in a technical way such as a stock is in a channel when it remains within  of its day ma for  trading sessions know why because if you actually define your analysis in such a manner it becomes easy to show it means nothing someone could run a quick and dirty back test and see  huh this pattern doesnt have predictive power 

the general refusal of people who claim
ta works to provide a single technical that can actually be tested is damning they claim its an art form well if they cant actually define in a purely technical manner what their buy and sell signals are they arent really doing technical analysis",deleted
Technical analysis,investing,Debate with friend on merits of technical analysis,"i have a friend who has been actively trading for two years now and he effectively blew up his account massive underperforming spy

his main criteria for stock selection is looking at charts  iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been telling him its effectively astrology and is disconnected from the underlying value countless studies on ta have found it to be useless and if there is signal it cant overcome transaction costs on top there are no known successful investors whos primary method is ta surely if it worked at least some would exist

his rationale is no matter how much you will try to dispute the technical trading the matter of the fact is that every institution is teaching the technical trading fidelity merril etrade tradestation etc that means that all the retailers and lots and lots of finance people follow those learnings i know that they do and attempt to consider that regardless of my beliefs i personally cant change sht but hole brunch of people that know same thing can no if you convince everyone that technical analysis is sht then my statement will be false

well its pretty clear that technical trading is front and center from browsing the front pages of cnbc bloomberg and yahoo finance let alone forums like this one 

do i just throw my hands up at this point and write him off as someone who is delusional beyond measure and will do anything to convince himself that ta will make him money",5,why do you want to convince him is it simply a fun debate to have if youre genuinely concerned about his money and he isnt listening to you thats on him,"ta as far as my understand takes me was the precursor of algorithmic trading which is real and can generate some alpha but the people developing those algorithms are generally employed by renaissance and cant be found on reddit

using just ta to trade is essentially astrology and retail certainly shouldnt be doing anything but index investing for like  of their portfolio but it does have its own academic merits","its price and volume thats all technical analysis looks at its also a self defeating strategy because if everyone buys right at that the buy signal that signal will cause a huge move meaning only the very select few that got in right before the move make money so people buy a bit early then the big move happens earlier and then people buy a bit sooner and sooner till the point that the buy signal is no longer a buy signal because people are buying before the buy signal 

its how arbitrage opportunities disappear as well they trade themselves into non existence 

the truth is that people use ta as a way to evaluate current price movement is moneyvolume flowing in or out ie what has happened in the past it does not predict what will happen in the future 

youll have better luck trading on how chipper jpow seems to be during his talks 

they teach these tools because theyll get engagement from numnuts who dont know any better"

theres obviously at least some market for quantitative algorithmic trading jobs

im just curious how much of this is publicly accessible theres spy and iShares S&P 500 Index Fund (IVV) and voo and Vanguard Total Stock Market VIPERs (VTI) people eat those up and love them

why wouldnt people love access to an etf that supposedly beats buy and hold through technical analysisquantitive analysisanything a company offering that could potentially rake in lots of money if the answer is very few of them beat buy and hold why is the industry as big as it is if you google does technical analysis actually work  you get a ton of articles saying yes it does this is contrary to what i would have thought

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) done a bit of light skimming on research papers related to computer programming algorithmic reinforcement training and its almost   of them say no correlation was found what we developed underperformed stock market price movement is basically random noise and the other  said yep totally possible we beat buy and hold

whats the truth im not looking to hear  in  people can successfully do tabe a day traderbeat buy and hold i want to hear why isnt it agreed upon that  out of  average people can beat buy and hold and if quant funds can beat buy and hold where are they are they really so secret that only people with millions can access them my friend has mm he put some into something claiming to be a quant fund its down  this year",469,"why isnt it agreed upon that  out of  average people can beat buy and hold

because the following things are all true

 some people do beat the market actually lots of people and funds do
 but that is also consistent with the random walk theory because if you have randomness youll still get a lot of random winners
 approximately  of those winners will attribute their winning to skill rather than luck
 also there have been some results like the sustained success of some specialized quant funds that suggest that it is possible to beat the market in such a way as to suggest genuine ability
 so there are winners through luck and winners through skill and its hard to determine which is which other than through complicated math to suggest probabilities

additionally the time element is critical here even in cases where someone has insight that gives them an edge thats usually going to have a limited lifespan before the market picks up on it

this is what goes wrong with lots of ta backtesting its one thing to construct something that worked upon a time but this could mean

 that amidst all the data  noise in the market if you look hard enough and long enough youll find something that looks like a pattern
 even if you find something that represented an edge in the past it may not be usable any more

xb

but theres always that uncertainty and these things are also true

 index funds are boring as shit compared to all the things you could be doing in the market it seems lame to just buy a wholemarket fund and chill
 particularly here on reddit with its bias for the young theres a huge resistance to accepting the conventional wisdom everyone wants to build their world differently from the previous generation
 confirmation bias is a very powerful thing and if you get lucky its very hard to believe that you were just that  lucky much more satisfying to attribute it to skill

the recent surge is owed to a confluence of circumstances including two major regulatory changes that made etfs far more appealing to wouldbe issuers in september  the us securities and exchange commission approved the socalled etf rule which standardized the regulations for launching and operating etfs that same year the sec approved the first active nontransparent etfs removing a major hurdle that had kept many active managers on the sidelines"
Technical analysis,investing,Two Questions About Technical Analysis,"i know people liken technical analysis to astrology but in my humble opinion technical analysis can give an idea of how mr market feels about a company basically when a company is oversold it means mr market hates it and when its overbought then mr market is in love with it having said that im not a technical investor i would base  of the investing decision on fundamental analysis and only  on technical analysis thats how i personally see it but im not really an expert so take what i say with a ton of salt  
  
if you happen to use technical analysis in your decisionmaking process which chart do you use do you use the yearly quarterly monthly weekly or daily and why do you prefer that time frame  
  
finally which indicators do you think show the overbought and oversold states",0,"basically when a company is oversold it means mr market hates it and when its overbought then mr market is in love with it

this is a tautology not a description of technical analysis technical analysis is the use of patterns in the price time series for an asset to predict future prices for that asset if you believe that investable patterns of this sort exist then you have to explain why tens or hundreds of thousands of professional investors with access to stateoftheart research computer hardware and trillions of dollars of capital have missed stuff that random neckbeards on youtube found by staring at publicly available charts it probably does happen from time to time due to sheer random chance but i personally dont plan to bet my retirement on it over the long term",if you ask me i use various times for technical analysis because different times would give a very different result say for instance company a has a healthy life time technical analysis but that does not mean that their  day or  days or even  months technical analysis is favorable again if you are  fundamental investing timing the entry is not that essential personally i would use  day to  year to time my entry point,"generally theres two interpretations to everything  eg rsi is high  oh my god overbought and going to go down or in an uptrend and likely to continue going up  

when i actually tried to do some broad analysis returns tended to be higher with both high and low rsi readings with the lowest returns in the middle of the range  but unsurprisingly much larger standard deviations for extreme values too  and simply by looking at a price chart you can kind of tell that without an indicator at all  

thats just a oneoff example but i found it to be more broadly true"

Market trends,investing,"Long term population trends, implication for real estate and other markets","was thinking tonight about how real estate has continued to become more and more expensive ie a good investment over the past  years however that price run up has been predicated both on the largest population explosion in human history as well as artificial construction of supply by nimbys and zoning laws in many parts of the world 

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) always assumed that aside from occasional collapses real estate will continue to drift upwards perhaps not a great investment compared to other assets but better than inflation 

the possibility exists of long term reversal of both of these supporting trends zoning laws are becoming threatened due to political backlash from how unaffordable housing has become at the same time life in general has become so unaffordable that fertility rates are now strongly below replacement values in most of the developed world 

cant say anything with any certainty of course but i think a future of continued growth of housing prices for the next century isnt a guarantee sounds obvious when i write it out but psychologically i had a deep seated assumption that the housing market was a guaranteed success long term  think that may require a rethink 

if population trends down in the developed world thats a possible future to consider when choosing investments fewer people could depress real prices of stocks in general  kind of difficult to know what types of companies would perform well in this scenario i suppose technology companies specializing in automation ai and robotics is the only market i can think of that would do well commodities construction nondurables energy all of those seem to be at risk from a general longterm decline in population and therefore in aggregate demand

this results from a misconception of what the market is  its movements are not the result of many individuals making decisions  its movements are based on money  if  million people sell  share each of a  stock and a single individual buys  million shares of that same stock the stock price will go up despite the fact that the individual was outnumbered quite literally 

whats more the big money mutual funds and holding companies doesnt make decisions based on wikipedia and google  rather they make decisions based on research of public records investor relations and through networks of mbas and investment analysts

the only people who could even begin to make money based on wikipedia and google are the hfts

in short if your capital is limited youre far better off with boring old research than trying some exotic method to overcome a problem thats bedeviled analysts since the advent of the public market

furthermore if there were a method for beating the market the moment it became public it would stop working

the blackscholes model for option pricing is an example of this  once upon a time there was no way to fairly price options and reliably make money  they were too opaque and there were too many variables  along came  dues by the names of black and scholes mindblown i know who developed a formula backtested it and then put it into practice when it showed promise  then they published it  in less than a year it had an effect on the market that reduced its profitability to a fraction of what it formerly was  to the point that the only way to guarantee gains with it was to trade millions of dollars in options at a time to achieve gains on the order of

i think its a matter of practicality the economy wont have a chance until people feel safe going out again and the evening news isnt full of stories of hospitals being overrun by the virus",until theres a vaccine andor herd immunity i think were going to have a hard time going back to normal im sure treatments and testing especially antibody testing will help us relax restrictions some but the cats out of the bag whether or not testing has found it yet i think its safe to assume covid is in every population center in the country
Economic indicators,investing,Macro Swing Trading | Using economic reports as leading indicators | Who is doing this?,"hello everyone

the last few months the markets moved a lot and with the fed having a lot of meetings concerning interest rate hikes and the overal economic condition it was pretty easy to time and predict the market negative news for the economy made positive news for the markets as soon as the cpijoltppipce numbers arrived on websites with summaries about macroeconomic reports the market responded accordingly

now im pretty new to macro swingtrading and im curious how the market react to those reports in different market conditions high low base rate expanding market contracting market etc

so i wondered who is using these reports in their swing trading how does it work out for you

hope to hear from you",43,"a lot of people  i learned of some groups who do swings around earning statements with options  its great until its not 

if you do this just stick to your script and dont get too crazy overconfidence leads to bust","it was pretty easy to time and predict the market

this is the kind of thing everything thinks is true until they actually try it

its not exactly the same thing but you can try your skills at predicting the past market



 and if you wanted to make it the same you could look for an archive of news from the fed corresponding to the dates in question",i try to time my options on fomc speeches and data reports lately

yes there are negative economic indicators most of which the markets are ignoring  which should remind you that the markets are not the economy  and the unemployment numbers are not the economy and gdp is not the economy and the labor participation rate is not the economy  in fact no single number is the economy

Economic indicators,investing,Why are people convinced rising rates will cause an economic collapse?,"iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen lots of comments on the sub basically dreading the  point since raising rates  to them  ensures economic collapse

what indicators are there unemployment is near alltime lows of the last twenty years vix is down and we are nowhere near deflation for that to be an issue housing prices are still incredibly hot

so what leads everyone to think that nudging rates high will cause collapse",420,"rising rates makes credit less accessible which leads to less consumption and eventually a possible recession this is on the consumer side on company sides its the same story borrowing is more expensive so that means they have to cut back job loss is usually a lagging indicator and housing prices being unaffordable and lower number of sales means an illiquid market which can go south fast or that people are borrowing too much money for homes

the main indicator that people will reference is the inverted yield curve or ym bonds being negative which means the bond market expects more economic uncertainty in the near term versus farther out another way to look at it is there is less confidence that borrowers will pay back loans in the near term

not enough cash relative to debt coupled with less productivity is a common cause of recessions","virtually ever recession starts when unemployment is near all time lows its a lagging indicator first softness then you are like shit its for real cut people

rates cause recessions because they quite literally stop commerce a k loan at  vs  increases the monthly payment by  even if the transaction happens that  that doesnt go to everything else vacations cars eating out onlyfans etc",well it sure as heck wont cause an economic boom

stock,investing,PSA: Stock promotion and suspicious stock recommendations,"for those new to reddit and to investing subreddits  many people often complain that rinvesting mods are too draconian in removing posts and comments

one reason is that we often get posts from bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype you can sometimes identify if its a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks this morning  an account which only posted porn in the past to collect karma suddenly starts to post investing advice and stock recommendations

one other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the original poster never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) those are all signs of stock promotion

if you are new to reddit rinvesting  and you wish to post E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) please see the wiki guidelines for appropriate E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) here

for those interested in understanding a little more about stock promotion  one of the mods provided an ask me anything  years ago about a penny stock pump operation that he unwittingly became associated with   you can find the ask me anything here",1339,"glad to see something happening

its so obvious when you see someone post hey guys check out stock and their entire post history is posting it in different subs everybody trying to copy what happened earlier this year cant wait for that to end","the decline in the quality of financial subs since Gamestop Corporation (GME) has been attrocious its very disappointing and its becoming impossible to find discussion that doesnt almost immediately devolve to the equivalent of people just shitting in their hands and throwing it at one another 

it led to me deleting my old reddit account and limiting my individual picks for stocks i came back to reddit though basically because im weak for it but also because i hold hope for things returning to how they were pregmeinduced reddit influx or at least somewhere near a lot of these new ones are going to lose all of their money eventually or just get bored

i dont have much of a suggestion for what mods can do really other than continue to police it banning E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) would be such a shame for us one thing i think is unavoidable though is the degree to which the storm has to be ridden out",weve been brainstorming on the issue for a while now but its an inherently complex problem and thus hard to just automoderate suggestions are welcome

following the increase hertz asked the bankruptcy court thursday to allow it to sell up to  billion in shares a last ditch effort for it to raise capital even though the value of the stock could get wiped out the request 

hertz said in a government filing monday that it would sell up to  million in common stock it warned potential investors that its 

such a sale is highly unusual for a company going through chapter  bankruptcy proceedings since common shareholders who are last in line when assets are allocated during court proceedings may be left with worthless stock

the court in its ruling said the approval in no event will result in the issuance of the shares the debtors are authorized but not required to sell shares of the common stock

the stock also could be delisted hertz in a public filing with the  that it has appealed a delisting request by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)

seriously this place has become a fear mongering echo chamber lately last week people were asking if they should buy at all time highs now people are shitting themselves because everything is on sale i am going to unsubscribe and try to focus more on my side hustles to generate more cash for buying see item  i am not saying this to be a dick i am saying it because it is legit unhealthy to freak out and surround yourself with other people that are freaking out

downvote away and peace out brothers",2668,im buying too but i dont think it makes sense to accelerate or decelerate regular dca intervals just doing my regular thing,"take a deep breath 

no this is how you catch covid","unlike speculations or other types of bubbles or news that make the market go down a corona pandemic is the kind of thing that actually affects the underlying revenue of the market  people dont go to cinema dont go on cruises companies dont make money go bankrupt etc 

if you believe in any way that the value of a stock is correlated to the underlying revenue and assets of a company which it should then it makes perfect sense that the market goes down not only because of panic sell but realistically there will be months with no revenue or negative revenue for a lot of companies so their value as a multiple of that has to reflect that

yes things will bounce back again of course and it will go back to normal but it will not make up for  months or so when people didnt use the companies services like if people dont go to cinema for  months because of fear of virus they wont say after its done ok now we go  times per week to cinema to make up for how much we missed theyll just resume going to cinema regularly those of quarters of revenue with missed losses will be forever negative on a company books"

trade,investing,Gamestop Big Picture: Evolution of a Trade,"disclaimer i am not a financial advisor this entire post represents my personal views and opinions and should not be taken as financial advice or advice of any kind whatsoever i encourage you to do your own research take anything i write with a grain of salt and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch also full disclosure i hold a net long position in Gamestop Corporation (GME) but my cost basis is very low and im using money i can absolutely lose my capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours

so i mentioned possibly doing a post mortem on my Gamestop Corporation (GME) trade and apparently that was in high demand  that being said ill call it an evolution instead as we still dont yet know what will happen next

rather than going through a full narrative i made a  to chronicle some of the key points in my trade decisions

strangely enough i think it might better convey how the week went from my perspective a little better than a full narrative  if you catch any inconsistencies between the chart or my writing below please point it out  its very easy to ex post facto ascribe to yourself the benefit of  foresight and overlook mistakes you made at the time

ill walk through my thought process for newer traders  keep in mind im trading my hobby account not a selfdirected ira so the stakes are a lot lower and tolerance for risk is much higher

 i would probably trace the initial origins of this trade for me back to november  i wasnt a genius like dfv finding Gamestop Corporation (GME) at that point but once the pfizer and moderna vaccine efficacy data came out i decided to go rummaging through xrt retail  and other unloved sectors for value that should rebound on the sector rotation to the reopening trade given the nosebleed multiples in qqq the nasdaqbig tech companies that dominated the market in   figured id mostly ride the shaking my head semiconductor index and a few other favorites while digging around  looking at unloved sectors is the valuelong term investor version of buy the dip typically the dip might last years but i figured in this case the evolution would be much faster because it would be driven by progress against covid
 idd Gamestop Corporation (GME) for the short list because of an unusually regular pattern on the daily chart rsi  in hindsight i would probably attribute that to one of the hedge funds trying to stealthily unwind its short position veeeeery slowly but Gamestop Corporation (GME) being a dead corner of the market it shows up in the data like a lighthouse beacon in a channel upward just bouncing off rsi   someone is gradually accumulating a big long position or covering a big short position  tjxs looks better but valuation too high already overloved
 deep dive E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) including E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) from wsb just makes me think this is exactly what iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been looking for  better buy in before it escapes completely  
 okit made some massive moves already but with the bonus of the short interest anomaly this is too good  and it comes with awesome memescant say no to the package deal  my first buy is pretty good but ill write april  cashsecured puts to net me a better entry or additional profit if they go unexercised  this is a common technique investors can use to get either a better entry than they otherwise could get or some participation in the upside if the price runs awayi find it easier to do this than setting an aggressively low gtc limit buy and keeping my fingers crossed
 digging deeper into the short squeeze thesis tells me its practically mathematically guaranteed to go off any moment  i take off some cashsecured puts liquidate a lot of the rest of my portfolio etc because if things get as crazy as i think they might its better to have almost nothing else in your portfolio to complicate matters  this is especially true as margin requirements start rising
 volatility starts going crazy  you almost cant see it on the daily chart with the scaling of the  peak but if you focus on the  to  timeframe there were a few brutal eiffel tower moves parabolic up then down  all kinds of misinformation about what is going on starts flying  people start fomoing into those moves only to despair out on the other side for a loss  few if any seem to be willing to talk about the situation in a way that newer traders can understand  i start posting a bit here and there just getting a feel for reddit
 on  i see a few heated discussions regarding whether the gap up over the weekend then crash down that day in fact was the squeeze and i try to jump in and correct the record a bit people are panicking out on the downside of that move because theyre being told the squeeze is over  that motivates me to write my first article in the series  dont finish it that evening decide to finish it in the morning  it drops on this sub essentially as what we now know was the squeeze is achieving liftoff
 looking at my posts from  to  im probably too tuned in to the hype but tuning in to sentiment is important in sentimentdriven momentum trading  i do try to consistently try to warn new traders from fomoing in but that doesnt stop me from trying to help them understand what is going on
 one thing iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) learned the hard waydont carry a sentimentdriven momentum trading position through a weekend  that usually does not end well
 the weekend gives me time to step back and resume a more analytical approach and you may notice my writing style reflects that at that point  looking back i notice a lot of sloppiness and some outright errors in my realtime read of the situation  i try to point some of those out if i feel they might be material to others trading decisions
 at this point im thinking the squeeze has been mostly squoze but for a few technically its still possible type scenarios  i figure since so many of the regular readerscommentators on my posts are going to ride it ill keep a position on to ride it with them too  well see where we go from here

i actually did really well on the trade overall  could have done much better had i just stuck to my trades rather than reading and writing on reddit but the numerous comments iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen where i or other commentators in this sub were able to provide good levelheaded feedback and advice helped people make better decisions make it worthwhile to me  i guess it just bothered me too much to see the vacuum of real information and willingness of people to push their trade on others  i didnt see that kind of behavior in wsb even just the week prior when i first joined

also while it turned out very well i have to be completely intellectually honest and admit that i could have lost it all too  this was a crazy volatile trade with more twists and turns and unexpected developments than i could have imagined and thats even given that i actually believe it when i say that i dont know what will happen next  this is something anyone knowingly walking into this type of situation should realize and plan for

each person has a different tolerance for risk though i will say that while i was and am willing to take significant risks with my hobby trading account i try to never take entirely irrational risks  i also actively put at risk a relatively small percent of even my hobby trading capital   it may not seem like it as youve seen my writing on a high volatility play but my overall capital disposition is very conservative and lowrisklowvolatility in aggregate  its because i know that most of it is safe that i can feel comfortable and controlled making very high risk plays

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen people put it all on the line and totally clutch trade big momentumi wish i could but i know thats not me

there are a few sayings that traders have as almost jokes but with an undercurrent of dark humor in many cases

 rule  never lose money from warren buffett value investing legend  im a little more flexible with this for myself and amend it to always have a plan that guarantees you can never lose more money than you intended to put at risk  if you are in the red on this trade realized or unrealized dont feel badim very confident that most people are in the same boat  try to think of it as tuition for one of the most intense and hopefully intellectually productive seminars ever held only once every decade or so
 no one ever went bankrupt taking profit or pigs get fat hogs get slaughtered counterpoint tons of people have gone essentially bankrupt riding profits right back into the groundparticularly in climactic late bubble market action like the dotcom bubble  to those of you feeling bad that you could have made more be glad that you were in the green  its something to celebrate  you traded a black swan event and came out ahead
 buy low sell high  much harder to do consistently than it seems  particularly if you initiate a   for those of you who did this try to remember what that was like and think of ways you can manage those emotions in the future or ensure you never put yourself in a similar position if youd rather not have to  either approach will be healthier for both you and your wallet in the long run

alright this post is long enough as is  well see where the rocket takes us tomorrow

i still think i was right in the decision to fear of missing out buy i bought a day before the big jump to  but i was absolutely wrong to trust the echo chamber and not sell when we saw the whole system turn against us once rh and other brokers restricted buying for more than one day i should have pulled out the day before it dropped to  closing i still would have made a profit if i sold in the morning 

an extremely expensive lesson and currently im just going to hold the stock it seems reasonable that the price may go higher than the current  if rc and his team turn the company around  the money i get from selling now wont make a huge difference to me in the short term anyway

Stock market,stocks,Indicators Explained For Newbies in Stock Market,"i along with probably many others here are new to the trading world Gamestop Corporation (GME) sparked our interest but we know this isnt how the market usually works with that being said iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been doing some research on the different features and functions provided in different web applications so i figured id share some basic info here to try and help some others

here is a very basic explanation of the different indicators i have got i guess some of you already have in your charts

  this gives weekly indicators and works best when you have a stock portfolio also if you have option trading their risk factor is also improved through their collective intelligence indicators platform which is an interactive platform between the team and its users where they ask questions about the future trends of the market  
  this finds the position of a security within bollinger bands b is simply a percentage measure of a securitys location between the bands b can be lower than  or higher than  if price moves outside the bands generally speaking a b near or above  can suggest an overbought market while a value near or below  can indicate an oversold market

  are used in technical analysis to measure a markets volatility it is a banded indicator similar to bollinger bands b besides measuring a markets volatility donchian channels are primarily used to identify potential breakouts or overboughtoversold conditions when price reaches either the upper or lower band these instances would indicate possible trading signals

  this is a technical chart indicator that tracks the price of an investment like a stock or commodity over time the ema is a type of weighted moving average wma that gives more weighting or importance to recent price data

  a collection of technical indicators that show support and resistance levels as well as momentum and trend direction it does this by taking multiple averages and plotting them on the chart it also uses these figures to compute a cloud which attempts to forecast where the price may find support or resistance in the future

  a banded indicator similar to bollinger bands and moving average envelopes they consist of an upper envelope above a middle line as well as a lower envelope below the middle line the middle line is a moving average of price over a userdefined time period either a simple moving average or an exponential moving average are typically used the upper and lower envelopes user defined are set a range away from the middle line this can be a multiple of the daily highlow range or more commonly a multiple of the average true range

ma moving average  a simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price the average is taken over a specific period of time like  days  minutes  weeks or any time period the trader chooses there are advantages to using a moving average in your trading as well as options on what type of moving average to use moving average strategies are also popular and can be tailored to any time frame suiting both longterm investors and shortterm traders

pivot point  a technical analysis indicator or calculations used to determine the overall trend of the market over different time frames the pivot point itself is simply the average of the intraday high and low and the closing price from the previous trading day on the subsequent day trading above the pivot point is thought to indicate ongoing bullish sentiment while trading below the pivot point indicates bearish sentiment

sar  the parabolic sar is a technical indicator developed by j welles wilder to determine the direction that an asset is moving the indicator is also referred to as a stop and reverse system which is abbreviated as sar it aims to identify potential reversals in the price movement of traded assets it can also be used to provide entry and exit points

supertrend  this indicator works well in a trending market but can give false signals when a market is trading in a range it uses the AptarGroup, Inc. (ATR) average true range as part of its calculation which takes into account the volatility of the market the AptarGroup, Inc. (ATR) is adjusted using the multiplier setting which determines how sensitive the indicator is",5368,"the best indicator for newbies is this one

if you see  threads a day about a stock youre too late",i personally use only  moving average at  periods all the rest of my analysis is based on fundamentals and future growth,thank you for writing this out when i first learned about vwap it changed how i approached day trading entirely another indicator i would suggest new traders to explore and monitor would be macro sentiments which also helps to determine if a stock is currently overbought or oversold

 early stock trading happened at coffee shops and stocks were hand written in paper and inventors had to trade their stocks with other investors in coffee shops
 it was tough to make out legit companies to illegitimate companies back in the day and in many cases companies were able to make tons of money before a single ship was ever set for sail and because of that a bubble was burst and the government of england banned the issuing of shares until 
 and despite ban of issuing shares london stock exchange was established in  it was very limited exchange because of the ban of issuing shares
 and in  new york stock exchange was established and it started trading since its very first day
 and today almost every single country has a stock market  every day trillions of dollars are traded on stock markets

when a company pays dividends the stock usally drops the same amount on the xday the owners will get the money like  weeks after the day the xday
lets say a company pays a  dividens so the stock drops  on the xday 
wouldnt it make sense to buy it right there because the stock should go up later when the owners gets the dividens and reinvests it is this already priced in


edit i came looking for confirmation bias but found real advice not happy this subreddit gets a",345,just try it out and tell us your experience,little known secret is that you can actually profit by doing this with any stock even if they dont pay dividends by buying it when it goes down and selling it when it goes up,if the company yields  and pays quarterly the dividend will be  also assuming a stock does not fluctuate randomly and is perfectly priced relative to its dividend its value will gradually increase until the next dividend date then drop again so its not like it would drop  then go back up   if they were paying  a quarter that  would accumulate over the course of the three months
Trading strategy,stocks,Trading strategy for when you’re up?,"i have a rough idea of a strategy for what to do when a stock i hold goes down  i can dollar cost average to lower my cost basis  this strategy works as long as i have money to throw at the stock and if i assume that the stock will go up again  thats a big assumption i know

what do you guys do when you hold a stock that has made gains and is up  when and how much do you sell

for a while i thought that i should hold for a year or more to pay the lower long term tax rate but that idea seems fairly poor when the market is extremely volatile 

a strategy i have considered is to sell all my shares and then rebuy at the same level to lock in gains  i think this would lock in any profits in the near term and could enable further dollar cost averaging if the shares go down again  if the shares continue to go up then at least i still have them

what are your thoughts",6,"if you sell and rebuy you have to pay taxes on the sale so youd need to buy back at a much lower level for your plan to work

basic stock jargons  shortlong positions

long  youre buying and holding a stock with the intention for it to increase in value

short  youre borrowing shares from a lender brokerage investment firm individual investors selling it to someone and hoping to buy it back at a lower price your profit is the difference in the sell and buy back price ill provide a real world example because this concept it a bit more complex

 person a is a share lender they want to lend the share and get paid a small interest rate as compensation
 person b asks person a to lend him that share temporarily person b does not pay anything upfront but he promises to pay person a in the form of interest over time
 person b finds a buyer person c person c wants to buy a stock so it can go up person c is long on this stock person b however is short on this stock because he wants the value of the stock to go down
 person c pays person b  for the stock now person c has spent  and person b has gained  
 two hypothetical situation happens now
    scenario  stock value increases to  person c is now up  and he sells because hes making nice gains person b needs to buy back that share at  but he only gained  profit initially now he needs to fork up  to buy back the share and then return the share back to the lender  any interest accrued in this scenario the short lost money the long gained money and the lender made interest money 
    scenario  stock value decreases to  person c is now down  and he sells to cut losses person b needs to buy back that share at  but he already has  in profit initially now he pays  for the share leaving him still with  profit and returns the share back to the lender  any interested accrued in this scenario the short made money the long lost money and the lender made interest money 
 the above scenarios help to show why shorts typically hedge funds or experienced traders might want to manipulate the stock price to go down hedge funds have an incredible amount of power in the market which i will explain in a bit and can often create serious price movements to invoke price action that benefits themselves shorts therefore have the opposite intention of longs they want share prices to go down and in the process can bankrupt certain companies that rely on the stock market liquidity to stay afloat in other words when investors leave a stock because it is dropping in value the company loses that money that they could have used to pay off debt grow the business develop new products pay for expenses etc 

market manipulation

market manipulation is not new to the scene investors have long known of the existence of stock market manipulation tactics and every day we may observe some levels of manipulation in specific stocks specific categories or industries of stocks or the entire market market manipulation is defined as any actions performed with the intention of moving a certain stock price in favor of the manipulator in this case these are the wealthy whales or hedge funds both of which have enormous capital capable of shifting stock prices at alarming speeds keep in mind not all hedge funds do this and not all hedge funds are shorts some are neutral and act as lenders to make money some are growthbased and invest just like everyday traders with the intention of raising share prices and others are short which are probably perceived to be the sadistic groups of the bunch below i will be discussing how manipulation occurs and on different scales

manipulation tactics on a spectrum

market manipulation can happen in certain stock sectors or the entire market there are probably far more types of manipulative tactics than we know but i will describe the most basic types and the strategies behind it

scenario 

lets say a hedge fund just opened a short position on stock x stock x is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock hedge funds are not too excited about this increased share value so they can hedge or protect themselves by selling put options when they sell puts they are anticipating that the stock will continue to surge which causes the puts to become worthless at expiration but on the contrary they will be collecting the premium or money paid upfront by traders that bought the put at the same time this hedge fund will slowly cover or buy shares of stock x so that the increased value of the shares will offset the short position which is losing money the manipulation here is by using the sheer amount of capital in hand to bolster the stock both creating favorable conditions for the puts that they sold and the share that they purchased as cover if they want to add another level of manipulation to this they can also purchase call options which will result in profit if the stock price goes up in this scenario hedge funds make money at the expense of put option buyers and other shorts that do not have manipulative power or capital to recreate this same strategy

scenario 

lets say a hedge fund just opened a short position on stock x stock x is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock this hedge fund does not want to risk extra capital to cover their short position by buying shares selling put options or buying call options so they try a different route keep in mind that hedge funds are typically heavily invested in many stocks and assets meaning they have a lot of power in deciding the direction of many stocks that have potential to instill widespread fear across the entire market if it drops take for example if apple and google began to hurl downwards this can create panic in the market where everyday traders might sell their shares at a loss this in turn might ripple through the market as other investors in other stocks are predicting a downward trajectory across the market since these big name stocks are losing value so rapidly conveniently enough hedge funds own a lot of these big name fang stocks

 if i am a moderately sadistic hedge fund i can sell off a large holding of shares in the scale of multi millions or billions that are in the same sector as stock x which would incite fear across the sector creating panic sell offs the price will drop sharply across the board including stock x and the short position will produce big profits because this hedge fund sold off a large chunk of their shares at a good price they can now cover their short position essentially getting rid of it and then buy up these same stocks that were let go earlier only this time at a much cheaper price the hedge fund has now made money not only on the short position but now they got into the stock at a cheap price in which they can explore other manipulative tactics to bolster the price again this can be done by encouraging analyst upgrades publicizing newly purchased positions without disclosing the fact that they previously owned it etc 

scenario 

this one involves technology algorithm trading commonly referred to as algo trading this one is a really intricately designed manipulative tactic that investors really have no way of getting around algorithm trading is the process of using highspeed supercomputers and a team of traders to constantly monitor market activity and trade when opportunities arise in this case the hedge funds do not have to do any direct manipulation of the market which makes this  legal how this works is by taking advantage of how trading works and the time it takes for a trade to be made for you general investors we have mobile apps and webbased trading platforms to trade when we like a stock we have to go through the motion of inputting the stock ticker symbol the amount of shares the price we are willing to pay hit submit and confirm the trade for hedge funds using algorithm trading all this is done autonomously which makes submission of an order several magnitudes quicker when an order is submitted it goes through a brokerage fidelity webull etrade tda rh etc and the data is rerouted to a clearing house intermediate party that verifies and processes the trade clearing houses are responsible for making sure your orders are filled but they take it on a first come first serve basis so if a stock is moving quickly hedge funds have a serious edge in getting in cheaper and faster as well as getting out higher and faster 

algorithm trading is integratable as part of the buying and selling strategies mentioned in the two previous scenarios which is why they can almost guarantee profit algorithm trading also uses a lot of data in their backbone to determine the trades that have a high chance of profitability and it acts on various factors such as volatility volume interest activity news etc in some cases these algorithms can be set to do some extremely sadistic things ill start by talking about market orders vs limit orders before you make a trade on your brokerage you will notice an option that says market order or limit order market orders are an agreement that you will purchase the stock or option contract at the best price in the market in the momentary space in time there is of course a huge risk to that because in that short moment in time there may not be anyone selling at a good price and instead some people might set sell limits at ridiculous prices for example some people set a sell limit at  for Gamestop Corporation (GME) if you did a market order and you get really unlucky you might end up snagging a share for  each when the actual share value might be  however when you set a limit order you are agreeing to buy a share at a maximum price that you designated 

in the event that a hedge fund siphons a ton of shares of a company the algorithm can be set to sell these shares at a ridiculous sell limit remember when they buy or sell its processed significantly faster at the clearing houses so if youre that one unlucky trader that went for a market order on a stock you might end up purchasing it at a huge premium set by the hedge funds themselves moral of the story do not purchase as market order  always purchase at limit order

the last dip under  was the th buy tqqq time to sell the st up over   
bought sqqq at  or after google earnings terrible report up  so far holding until under  again

is this a good strategy basically doing the opposite of the market shorting when others are greedy and buying when others are fearful the fg index seems to catch the days when market flips",5,"how far back did you backtest it there are a lot of false signals from what i can tell

for example you would have bought tqqq when the index dropped to  on april  only to watch the qqq make a lower low if you sell when the index hits  you would have sold for a small loss 

you would have shorted on july  when the index hit  only to watch the qqq rebound after a brief pullback and make a significant new high",i did this a couple years back  after about  months i made about the same amount as if i would of just left my funds in voo,good luck being contrarian is rarely a good strategy
Trading strategy,stocks,Trading Strategy on Capital Gains/Losses,"i  same question over in tax and didnt get any actual input

has anyone taken this approach  if so what are the upsidesdownsides

i  have  in long term and short term capital gains this year and im looking at a pretty hefty tax bill  between state and federal taxes i estimate ill owe 

im under the impression the odds are in favor of me day trading   theoretically there is a  the markets will go up or down  if i buy k of spy for example and only hold it for the day  i  theoretically have a  chance of making money  however if it goes down  and i sell i realize a  loss  this would lower my capital gains to 

instead of me paying the govt  on   id pay  on    which means my  loss of  is essentially a loss of  or   and if it goes up same thing  i make  and have  left over after taxes

as long as i have capital gains is there any downside to this strategy",6,there is essentially never a benefit to intentionally losing money to offset capital gains you will always lose more money then you would have had to pay in taxes the only benefits could be if you had an opportunity cost to allocate capital elsewhere or if for some bizarre reason there was changing legislationtax brackets upcoming just pay your taxes,"man you robbed  min of my life thinking about this shitty theory making any sense

it does not losses are losses gains are gains only thing you can decide is you want to have more cash now tax harvest or later hold 

at best market tanks and you lose k if you harvest you have k more cash in your pocket today instead of some point later in your investment life but market did fuck you nice strategy","i was just thinking the same thing sort of sell a chunk of net losers wait  days and rebuy it would reduce my taxes from other income sources 

also depending on your tax bracket long term gains are lower tax  than short term the trick would be to realize your enough losses to cover realized gains while holding the unrealized gains long till next year to lower the tax bracket while also avoiding wash sale

you can deduct capital losses up to the amount of your capital gains plus   if married filing separately you may be able to use capital losses that exceed this limit in future years 

so in your case you could lose up to  this year  

this is known as taxloss harvesting by the way"

i did over  trades in this manner over the last week and hit a win rate of  and made  gains on the paper account  to  im aware the paper account was not taking htb fees and keeping track of maintenance requirements but this was more an exercise in achieving a consistent win rate if i had made the exact same traded and cover a few days after the initial short my win rate jumped to  ill have photos of the trades as  well an excel sheet detailing the individual trades as well as analysis scaleing down to a minimum margin account complying with pattern trading regulations 

im looking for advice on if this is actually viable outside of a paper trading environment can a win rate like this be achieved and should i bring in anymore analysis outside rsi macd kdj and volume to float any advice from people who short stocks regularly would be appreciated",8,do you have a solid exit strategy only takes one short position to go wrong and game over,i think shorting is way under utilized by people,

Options trading,stocks,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,"i want to preface this post by saying that i personally only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks with that being said i have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis if you already have a bit of experience with options this post may not be very beneficial to you because im just going to cover the basics of options how they work and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them

first and foremost what are options options are actually options when you buy an option contract you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a predetermined price up to a prespecified date if you decide to do this you are then exercising your options

there are two types of options that you can trade which are call options and put options call options or just calls allow the holder to buy at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock because of this your call options price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises put options or just puts allow the holder to sell at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to shortselling the underlying stock because of this your put options price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines because one single option contract represent  shares of the underlying stock you would have  shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised

 

now the predetermined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contracts is known as the strike price when buying options you have to choose a strike price along with an expiration date which is the last day that your options can be exercised both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy because they greatly affect how the options will trade before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options its important to know a bit more general options information

as for strike prices there are really two main kinds in the money itm and out of the money otm itm and otm refer to the underlying stocks price in relation to the strike price of the contract calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered itm whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered otm on the other side of the spectrum since you want the stocks price to go down when you own puts your put options would be itm if the strike price is above the current stock price and otm if the strike price is below the current stock price

 

i know its a bit confusing if youre new to options to give an example if stock xyz was trading at  a call option with a strike price of  would be itm since the underlying stock is already above the strike price however since calls and puts are essentially opposite a put with a strike price of  would be an otm put in this scenario

whether an option is itm or otm has a big impact on how to option will trade the main reason for this is because all otm options are worthless at expiration this means that if you invested  by buying one call option at   x  your contract would be worth  if it was otm at the markets close on the expiration date and you would lose your full  investment because of this otm options are generally higher risk higher reward than itm options although itm wont be worthless at expiration like otm options they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay

time decay in options causes the price of the contracts also known as the premium to decrease as it gets closer to expiration this alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay so in order to profit from options you have to not only be right about the stocks direction but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay

time decay along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts are represented by what are known as greeks the greeks are theta vega delta and gamma like i said the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so im not going to go into a ton of detail on the greeks in this post but i do at least want to explain theta theta is the greek representing time decay in options you can see an options theta along with the other greeks before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay generally the theta will be higher for otm options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at  similarly theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches

theta makes general trading rules like dont fight the trend even more important for example if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support so in this situation youd be correct about the stock finding the bottom but you would still lose money if it didnt start to bounce back up quickly if you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options youd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support

 

although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades there is actually a way to have it work in your favor you can short options contracts which is also called writing just like with shorting stocks you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short in my opinion this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling

the reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts you would lose money as the options increase in price its the same reason that many people are afraid to shortsell stocks but options are generally more volatile which creates even more risk even though i wouldnt necessarily recommend it for beginners i wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post

regardless of how you trade options its important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced like any other type of trading you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options especially if youre trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time

maybe after this youll see why i stick to trading stocks rather than options they can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders but theyre much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns

hope this was helpful let me know what ya think",1862,so one of the main reasons to trade options is to be given the opportunity to trade with leverage,"great post by the original poster one aspect he did not touch on is the fact that all the pieces that go into the value of an option act like exponential curves why is this important to understand

lets start with theta or time value theta decay is not linear if we compare an april and july option of the same strike the value of the option will drop more tomorrow in the april option than it will in the july option in fact there is virtually no theta decay in the july option right now theta decay really becomes important to consider  days before expiration

in my trading i prefer to trade in options  days out it will cost me more to own that theta but it also gives me the chance to change my mind in the first few weeks without losing theta value this is a more conservative approach i use options to generate small incremental returns or to add some profit opportunity to core positions when i think a news item might move the stock sharply

the next variable to consider is called delta  this variable measures the rate of change expected in the option relative to the underlying stock price if i buy a  strike call on a stock trading at  the option should rise  for each  rise in the stock  this is called delta  in the industry the one is shorthand for  or   the option price change will reflect  of the stock price change delta  means  optimally you want an option that goes from delta  or  to delta  with  days left before expiration you get the benefit of the share price move and preserve some theta value you can recapture in the sale  unfortunately there are no freely available tools that will tell you the delta of a particular option without them you have to just feel it out but a good rule of thumb is a  differential is roughly delta  and a  differential is probably delta  ie the option is not going to budge much even if the stock moves 

you will get the most out of an option if you can play those periods where the delta is increasing rapidly take that  stock again lets buy a call option with a  strike price if the stock goes to  the option will not move much as the stock rises more the option will react more this is how you can make a very high rate of return on options that  strike premium will make the option quite cheap maybe a  depending on the other variable if the stock gets to  that option is probably close to  triple your money

the last important variable is vol short for volatility a stock that has large frequent swings is more likely to hit any given strike price than a slowmoving stock traders price the options differently as a result in bull markets general stock market vol declines which generally means that individual stock vol declines as well on average but if markets start behaving dramatically stock option values increase as this vol becomes more valuable this is why having some puts in your portfolio after strong bull markets might make sense puts increase in prices as stocks fall and as vol increases its a double payday

the value of an option is largely the sum of these three variables theta is a cost you have to just accept the higher the delta in an option the less risk you have of losing everything at the cost of muchreduced upside since changes in vol are very hard to predict it is really just a bonus if you catch it",public service announcement this post is missing a lot of key pieces to options trading

Fundamental analysis,stocks,Peloton fundamental analysis and valuation - The market is irrational!,"peloton has been a public company for less than  years and its share price has been all over the place it is now down over  since its alltime high back at the end of december  and the volatility has been crazy

the goal of this post is to analyze the companys fundamentals lay down some assumptions about the future and value the company as a whole

feedback is always welcomed

xb

what is peloton

in a nutshell it is a company thats making money by offering

 connected fitness products  exercise equipment bikes treads and soon rowing machines

 subscriptions  media content related to fitness pilates strength training stretching yoga meditation

 fitness apparel insignificant in terms of revenue at this very moment

xb

the hype

as we all know the pandemic caused this companys share price to go through the roof the demand for their products skyrocketed thanks to the lockdown and the media coverage of their products

connected fitness products

the revenue of their connected fitness products grew from m in  to b in   growth to b in   growth

note  their fiscal year ends  june hence  is the year starting july st  to june th 

however these products are generally considered more premiumluxury for the same amount of money one can subscribe to a budgetlevel gym for roughly  years and have access to a lot more equipment

during this period the gross margin that they had on these products was around  which is quite high for a company in this industry but the increased demand did its job well

until  started and the growth was nowhere to be found the revenue declined to b  and the decline was over  if the last quarter was to be compared year over year

not only that but the gross margin was  no it is not a typo they lost money on the sale of these products

when theres a huge decline in the level of demand it has a huge impact on the prices economics  of course the tough part was to estimate the level of demand for the coming period with all the uncertainty

in  the management put a lot of capital into inventory to meet the demand which wasnt as high as before so at the end of  as of june th theres roughly b in inventory thats roughly  of all the sales they made in the entire last year as the prices decline they had to take impairment for some of these products

subscriptions

this in my opinion is their cash cow segment it has been growing from m in  to m in   to m in   to b in  

the gross margin improved from  to  during the same period

it seems that the company is more focused on selling connected fitness products as a way to reach out to its target customers and actually make money on the subscriptions

xb

the other operating costs

if we combine both revenue sources together the total revenue for the last  months was b with a thin gross margin of  gross margin of close to m

every young company is known for incurring losses due to heavy spending on research  development and sales  marketing that would allow them to grow fast in that respect peloton is no different

in  the spendings were as follows

 sales  marketing  b
 general  administrative  b
 research  development  m

it is quite clear that the gross profit of m is not sufficient to cover these main operating expenses peloton lost over b from its operations  operating margin this is not that surprising as the majority of the highgrowth companies are losing money due to the higher than average spending on sales  marketing and research  development however when the growth is no longer there thats when it becomes ugly in addition i was not impressed by the level of rd spending as pelotons longterm success is highly dependent on its innovation

xb

but thats not all they had  onetime expenses during the year

 impairments  m  mainly related to goodwill part as mentioned above to inventories
 supplier settlements  m  based on the information available it relates to the settlement of litigation with ifit
 restructuring  m  as the demand falls the number of employees is reduced

it could be argued that these are onetime expenses as they were nonexistent in the past however as the demand is falling and their inventory levels are high it would not be surprising if there are further impairments further restructuring and who knows whether there will be further supplier settlements if we take all of this into account the operating loss of the company was b  operating margin

xb

the balance sheet

on the balance sheet apart from the high inventory levels mentioned above theres around b in cash although on its own is a big number it doesnt seem so big when we take into account the last years losses company had if the margins dont improve dramatically they will be raising capital during the next  months

they already have a debt of b for comparison purposes their market cap is b so theyre in a tough position

xb

striking deal with amazon

in the last  days there were  huge headlines the first one was the deal that peloton announced that part of their products will be available for purchase in amazon us stores

the share price went up around 

only a few days later they shared the  earnings and the share price returned to the same levels

this is a great example of how shortsighted the market can be at times the deal with amazon could be a great way to dispose of a large portion of the inventory thats just sitting there but amazon will take its share that means pelotons margins are not going to be as high lets not forget theyre already losing money on their connected fitness products

the more important question is is there going to be increased demand for their products regardless of whether theyre being sold through amazon or direct to the final consumer

xb

the key assumptions about the future  valuation

if we take a look at the analysts expectations regarding next years revenue it ranges from b for the entire year  compared to  to b  compared to  this huge expectations gap shows the uncertainty around the company

my personal views are that the amazon deal will help their connected fitness products to not have a significant revenue decline while the subscription revenue is still growing strong however i dont expect their operating margin to improve significantly in the next year

hence my assumptions are as follows

xb

 to  to 

revenue decline growth  year growth  year
operating marginslowly improve to slowly improve to 

my expectations are that the company has to focus more on costcutting and less on significantly growing revenue other than their subscription revenue

discount rate  today increasing to  in  years

based on those assumptions the fair value of the company is close to b share

the current market cap is b share

note i have taken into account the cash debt and deferred taxes on their balance sheet as well as the outstanding equity options

what if my assumptions are significantly wrong

based on the assumptions above the revenue will grow by  in  years and the operating margin will be 

i am aware that my assumptions could be significantly wrong so lets take a look at how the value of the company per share will change based on different assumptions regarding the revenue  years from now and the operating margin

xb

revenue  original poster margin

 b
 
 b
 b

xb

this table illustrates well how important it is for peloton to cut costs and improve margin in some cases the fair value of the company is even negative meaning its not worth anything of course one can argue that those assumptions are too pessimistic but there is a chance that it plays out

of course if they manage to grow  in the next  years which is the assumption of the most optimistic analyst and on top they improve the operating margin to  theres x upside

however that means peloton will need to bring b in revenue in  years just for comparison purposes the total gym revenue in the us is byear this is a mature market so growth is not expected

lets not forget that the share price at the peak of the hype was over share if that seems crazy it is only because it was crazy to justify a price of share peloton needs to bring in x the revenue of all us gyms combined and have a higher operating margin than 

xb

what are your thoughts on peloton as a company

also feel free to provide feedback regarding the analysis that is always appreciated",153,i think your assumptions were if anything generous  and the company is still overvalued x  i think a significant possibility here too is that the nature of this sort of exercise is faddish  as such peloton will decrease in popularity and wont hit your revenue projections  im skeptical of continued high growth in their subscriber business but thats probably because im biased against the company,"it seems likely that they will just be bought out eventually as their subscriber count is their largest moat considering people really do enjoy their instructors classes and how engaging they are

subscriber count is what matters most to peloton its now bringing in more revenue than their actual equipment i believe the amazon deal makes a ton of sense for peloton as it opens up the market for users people are confident when they shop at amazon because the customer experience is more secure 

their new CNOOC Limited (CEO) is the former cfo of netflix and spotify hes all about subscriber count and thats honestly where they need to be focused on","i generally agree with everything here to be fair though we just went through a onceinageneration pandemic with an unprecedented lockdown there was a very reasonable hypothesis that this period along with normalized fullyremote work was going to rapidly accelerate adoption of thing like ecommerce athome fitness etc that would persist after lockdowns ended total us gym revenue is a bit of a redherring because something like  of the population has a recurring gym membership and the vast majority of that is made up of inconvenient budget fitness providers around mediumtolarge population centers i dont think anyone is crazy for thinking there a massive opportunity for disruption that could blow the lid off the current market size

a lot of people and businesses bet on this both in the market and in business models it turned out to be mostly wrong but i dont think it was totally irrational

eta most major breakthrough investments looked completely irrational before they were breakthroughs there was a time when the thought of a textbased web search being worth t would have been insane"
Fundamental analysis,stocks,Why we do Fundamental Analysis?,"hi i am trying to understand the basic of investing why we use fundamental analysis and is it true that is more used by investor where the technical analysis is more used by traders

is fundamental analysis not as important when trading

thank you",10,"it comes down to goals and what you are doing 

fundamental analysis is looking at the value of the company and then trying to find undervalued companies and investing in them its for a long term play 

technical analysis is more about looking at day to day movements and trying to use psychology to figure out where a stock is heading and the price this is more used for swing traders or day traders not really something a long term investor would look into 

they are different ways of looking at the market but you use them differently depending on your goals",i am a short to midrange trader and i use fundamental analysis on every stock i consider  i use it as a rejector of stocks not so much as a selector of stocks  for me a stock has to have certain fundamental characteristics and if it doesnt i remove it from consideration  some of the fundamentals it must have are  positive cash flow yearly profit price above  and low cashflow to price ratio,"long story short stocks are not lottery tickets each stock represents a business that is worth x based on its assets and the cash flows that generates

if you can estimate how much a company is worth and be able to purchase below that amount youre going to be rewarded once the market realizes the mismatch between stock price and intrinsic value

thats why we do fundamental analysis"
Fundamental analysis,stocks,Fundamental analysis / Overwhelmed!,"i am confused and overwhelmed with information overload can someone give me an eli of what it is and also what are the most important things to look for when conducting a fundamental analysis of a company 

i see some websites say look for these  things but then i see on reddit some people have check lists  questions long",7,"the market is fucking stooopid
like a company can have made a profit no debt and their stock tanks and a company can have lost money every fucking year and the stock goes up let alone cancermedical research companies being shorted to penny stocks and companies who have never made or contribute a single fucking thing are  a fucking share so yeah let me know when you know brah","this is a field that entire careers are built around its like asking can you give me a list to instantly become an electrician

the material and methodology is learnable but it takes time and discipline there isnt a onesizefitsall way to do this which is why markets kind of exist thats also the reason why almost everyone not working in finance and even those that are keep the majority of their wealth in broadly diversified index funds youll track the market with zero effort

if youre trying to beat the market it is nearly impossible to do without a lot of effort education and research there are hundreds of books about valuation

there are some common and easy things to get a quick overview of the general valuation of a company but every single one is different and more importantly every industry is unique you have to really understand the productservice being offered how the business model works the market to which its offered and especially the competitive landscape and how one companys product is different than another

if you get a book on taking the series  exam the one for financial advisors it has a lot of good info about valuation and macroeconomics just skip all the legal stuff","the things i look for the most

 low pe ratio yes this is important lower than  ok lower than  cool lower than  great lower than  even better but ignore pe if its a small cap because most all small caps have a low pe
 high revenue growth  per year though it can be lower for some industries like retail or financial
 a roic of   calculated by   taking the average net income from the past  years and dividing it by share holder equity  longterm debt  shortterm debt
 are they buying back shares or offloading more and therefor diluting your shareholder value very important coin put out  more shares last quarter significantly cutting the value of their shareholders in one swoop
 are they making acquisitions are their retail locations increasing or decreasing is a important patent expiring is most of their new revenue from covid whos their competition are they losing market share etc etc you can discover this through the research phase after approving their financials but i base  of my decision by looking at numbers"
Fundamental analysis,stocks,UWMC A Fundamental Analysis of why this stock is deeply undervalued - The Latest in a Series,"hey r stocks admittedly i usually post this elsewhere and my series of due diligence on this stock is posted elsewhere but i thought that you guys could actually value this stock on deep value metrics please be aware this E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) is a day old and the stock has now been up for the last  trading days

greetings and salutations i wrote my last E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) on uwmc  weeks ago and it was the latest of a series with earnings announced and the recent runup from its lows i thought an update was in order as theres a lot of new information to parse through

first a status update on the stock price movement itself after my last due diligence the stock continued a downward trend down to  for a  dividend if you bought at that price point before it started sharply reversing course after a barclays analyst initiated coverage with a  price target stating that fy  eps was roughly  forward earnings for  and that uwmc was poised to grab more market share this was amid a prior backdrop of positive news coverage about how undervalued the stock was and how it was almost inexplicable spanning the motley fool investor place and seekingalpha in the days prior to this analyst coverage

the stock has been positive the last  trading days and sharply so it is up  on the week and  from its low point intraweek and stands at  right now that means it still has a dividend yield of  with earnings in two weeks shareprice appreciation is sure to follow

second i wished to speak about long term prospects for the stock as you might know the us is around  million homes short of buyer demand as homebuilder hesitation over the last decade has led to a meaningful undersupply as millennials age and will continue to age into their prime home buying years over the next few years wsj  us housing market is nearly  million homes short of buyer demand furthermore home builders would need to construct between  million and  million singlefamily homes a year to meet longterm demand but the start rate would need to be even higher to shrink the existing deficit said rob dietz chief economist at the national association of home builders id that means that homebuilders would need to build over  million homes to even start to cut into the  million deficit of homes however fret not because

thats because housing starts surged  to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of  million units last month which beat economist expectations of  reuters us housing starts near year high consumer sentiment rises moderately this is as home prices in the us soared  yearoveryear in march  to a median of  meaning that originations grew and partially offset the slightly shrinking inventory and thus sales housingwire home prices soared in march amid record demand what further offsets this is the increase in refinance and home purchase applications as rates have declined to below  for the first time in months forbes mortgage rates hit levels not seen in months this has led to a refinance surge of  and applications to purchase a home were  this should allow brisk business in q  and as refinance activity starts slowing further in the year there should be more inventory allowing purchases to help make up the shortfall considering uwmc has a  advantage on rates this should bode well for them

while  price increases for homes should be more subdued due to lower timber and associated materials cost as well as more labor they are still expected to rise furthermore the purchase market is going to grow in  from  and beyond the mortgage bankers association mba announced today at its  that purchase originations are on track to grow  to a new record of  trillion in  the mba forecasts volume to fall  this year to  trillion which would still be the thirdhighest total ever fannie mae and freddie mac are more optimistic with fannie may predicting  trillion in mortgage originations in  and freddie mac is predicting  trillion in mortgage originations in  with that said fannie mae recently revised upward from that  trillion number

this is what fannie mae predicted in their upward revised predictions

consistent with a stronger home price growth forecast the outlook for purchase mortgage originations has been boosted by  billion for  and  billion for  to  trillion each year compared to the march forecast refinance volume is unchanged at  trillion for this year and will decline  percent next year to  trillion a  billion downward revision from the previous forecast around  percent of all outstanding mortgages have at least a basis point incentive to refinance at current rates which is down from nearly  percent at the end of    april  

finally i expect interest rates to stay level or even dip more as people flock to tips   and as foreign investors continue to purchase treasuries though i am not sure how much stronger demand will be as theyve already returned

finally im going to talk about what can be expected regarding earnings and leading up to it

 msr asset value will increase organically as interest rates from feb  were at  roughly wsj  yr treasury table and have increased to roughly  as interest rates go up the value of msrs go up and this asset is continuously adjusted each quarter as a result
 with a net income of roughly  billion this quarter at minimum and a shareholders equity at b there will be a return on equity of  on this quarter alone and the roe will easily lie between  and  for fy 
 the annual income yield and the interest on the  senior notes and  senior notes comes to  million and  million respectively this is very very easily serviceable class a shares are dividend shares where class d stocks held by the owner are not this is incredibly bullish as the CNOOC Limited (CEO) would prefer to put the money he otherwise would have gotten back into the company to grow it if his class d shares were class a shares the annual dividend would be  million the payout ratio is still very low but i believe their CNOOC Limited (CEO) would rather use the money to eat market share and grow his company rather than be issued a dividend at least at this point in time
 the senior note raise of  million for  will prove to have been a bullish indicator as you need capital to originate loans and to secure more mortgage servicing rights the mortgage servicing rights will provide a constant stream of cash flow as well the company made over  billion dollars in net income last year and is on pace to have a similar tally this year though not quite as high because their bread and butter is purchase as opposed to refinance purchases have outpaced refinance at times this year and going forward into the second half of this year its going to remain that way uwmc does better in this environment and it will be able to gain and sustain market share as a result
 rkt earnings are on may th and i expect a sympathy move for uwmc
 may  is when russel reconstitution preliminary list comes out and i expect uwmc will be there
 may  will be earnings and may  will be the call with analysts to discuss results i think we can expect some heady things



position  shares and   may  contracts",77,too long; didn't read,great info to remind me why im still bullish on uwmc and rkt mortgage companies are undervalued Brunswick Corporation (BC) people know were in a bubble and are scared in my opinion,jump the gun back when it was hot with all the E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) and now i am stuck with a heavy heavy bag
Fundamental analysis,stocks,What kind of fundamental analysis do you do when deciding when a company is worth it?,i know understand the company in terms of their products management how they make money etc is important but other than that what factors do you take into consideration,177,"some of the advice here is pretty risky in my opinion particularly the huge value being put on income statement lines like revenue and net incomeearnings

what i personally look at from a financial standpoint is free cash flow adjusted for working capital effects and oneoffs and take this adj fcfenterprise value to get an idea of the historic return actually earned by the company i do like a bit of debt in the Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) because if a company has a solid recurring and preferably growing adj fcf they will be able to pay down their debt if they choose to an actually reduce the Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) thus increasing the adj fcf yield which should lead to an increase in their market cap

however you have to be careful about other stuff as well are there any other cfs on the investment side which seem to be strangely recurring if there are outflows subtract them from your adj fcf because they could be misclassified costs also its important to make sure that this fcf is sufficient to cover all dividends other financing costs and share buybacks so you know a company isnt shedding its substance like ge did for example 

basically when anything is not straight forward in the way you can interpret it take the worst interpretation of it into account

but i also look at the income statement and balance sheet because thats where the trickery is usually hidden if a company tries to present itself in a better light a disconnect between the adj fcf and earnings is usually a good indicator that theres some aggressive accounting going on because even if i like a company by their fcf if there is some aggressive accounting in the is  bs i wouldnt touch it because that stuff always catches up eventually and steady earners  who have to write all their shit off and take the overdue earnings hit get punished

then you have the underlying business its a dead horse by now and everyone tells you to but so few people actually do but if you want to learn anything about the business read the k and qs look for changes in risk factors compared to prior ks and qs google anything that isnt immediately clear to you read competitors ks and qs as well to see how they see and frame these businesses to make sure youre not falling prey to the underlying bias where a company always looks to present itself in a better light listen to the calls or read the transcripts and see if there are promises being made which never materialise and disappear 

do not look at the presentations on their website this is purely marketing material to sell the company to you","wow these comments are clueless except for the guy talking about fcf

focus on growth of the following
 roe
 fcf
 eps
  roic
 bvps

are all those growing consistently over time thats probably a solid business not going anywhere soon then

then check for red flags like ballooning debt or where their capex is going maintenance or expansion share dilution etc","this is my due diligence check list it helps me never question what i am supposed to do i analyze from the top and do the step which i feel are relevant id prefer to check them all at all times but its not always feasible

if theres anyone whos experienced in doing their own analysis or knows any good tutorials or good sources of information on teaching yourself how to do it id be very grateful

thanks",8,check out cfa i took level one learned a lot,"aswath damodaran is an nyu finance professor who also blogs and shares his valuations i highly recommend reading every one of his posts its not just about looking at todays balance sheet or even the last  years 

here is a post he did on his blog breaking down how he approached evaluting uber but the thought process is transferable to any business youll see the common theme in high growth companies is developing a narrative and defining the total addressable market much of a companys value is based on their future earnings but how does one forecast that its certainly more than a little art and theres a wide range for error so developing a valuation with a margin of safety also the name of a great book is key

its even more pathetic when wsb tries to use ta something that predicts movement based off of patterns on Gamestop Corporation (GME) a stock that has had a completely unprecedented rise and is solely governed by sources such as news tweets hedge funds and market makers 

i physically cringe anytime i see E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) that involves a chart and every time i do see one i instantly discredit the entire post there have been many studies that prove the natural randomness of the stock market overshadows any patterns and predictions that could be made and your chance of predicting a stocks movement off of ta is basically that of a coin flip fundamental analysis news and the current trend and sentiment of the market are infinitely more important for predicting a stocks immediate movement than ta could ever be

the only glimmer of credibility id be willing to give ta is scalping but even then  of daytraders lose money so id say its not even paying off for them well in that regard either

what it feels like to me is ta is a noob trap that attracts people who are new to the stock market because it makes them feel like they know what they are doing and they want an excuse to just gamble away their money iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) noticed a lot of youtube channels prey off of people thinking theyre some god of the stock market for employing ta and it gives them false credibility when in reality theyre just guessing as much as anyone like some fake scam psychic tarot card reading shit

Technical analysis,stocks,$BB - This Weeks Recap 3/12/2021 - Technical Analysis.,"happy friday everyone

what a god damn close almost hit that  mark but couldnt quite squeeze it out my thanks to all of you beautiful people who bought in the last  minutes of trading  million shares traded in the last  minutes to try and reach that strike price of  we still have afterhours to look at so we may actually close at or above  we met our max pain of  which is amazing up  on the week incredible

thank you all for averaging down and buying the dip we are going to have a lot of eyes on us this weekend and next week as well keep accumulating keep holding and lets keep the momentum up

lets take a quick glance at the chart as well as options for march 

we are above the day moving average and have just blown past a golden cross a bullish signal

hourly rsi screaming overbought looking like a retracement imminent  
bollinger bands are expanding this is good but we are not respecting the bands and are pressuring outside of them every time weve overextended the bands we retrace  
monday morning we might expect a gap down to correct ourselves but i will remind you that this would be a healthy retracement  
hour rsi almost overbought a cooloff may need to happen  
bollinger bands slightly beginning to expand and we hugging the top if we keep hugging the top this is good the bands didnt get as tight as i wanted but thats okay this could be a signal we remain moving up

daily rsi smack dead in the center very healthy  
bollinger bands are contracting more and more if they keep getting tighter and tighter we may see a massive break out in the coming days  
 days this week have been green i like green crayons they taste the best  
this is the highest daily volume weve had since march th and before that feb th i remind you though  million of those shares came up in the last  minutes of trading to try and reach that  strike price

weekly rsi slightly to the overbought side but still moderately healthy  
bollinger bands are still wide  
our first green candle in the last  weeks and it is a big one the secondlowest weekly volume that weve had since the beginning of the year this is huge because we dont need volume to move up this means people are not selling and are accumulating we know this to be true because of my previous posts of big institutions are buying

the top  funds holding bb based from  have all added to their positions in the last month hit ctrl  f and find them on  if you want to see dont just take my word for it im dumb dyod

monthly fuck you not relevant right now shut up

every whole number    etc for you dingbats will be a theoretical line of resistance we will need to push through each will be somewhat difficult but not near as hard as the one i have set  this one was the gapup signal to the upside and was used for the bounce on jan th acted as support on feb st and then resistance on feb th once this is secured we will need to get past it retest it as support and if it acts as support this bb will absolutely fly

options baby taken from  for march th 

total open interest calls   
total open interest puts 

putcall ratio  this is low as fuck and can be considered incredibly bullish to be bullish the ratio typically sits below 

the highest call open interest  at almost k open contracts second highest is  at k  
the highest put open interest   with k second is  with almost k contracts

do i see  happening next week no i really dont are opinions like assholes everyone has one  
could we close at  next week absolutely possible we have signs that we could go in either direction  
max pain next week is  should be easy but so is yo momma

my thoughts for next week i dont fucking know i dont have a crystal ball god damn it fuck off

if i was a magician id say it would be green about the same  as this week but i have confirmation bias and i also beat my weewee to kim possible when i was a teenager your guess is as good as mine but i digress lots of signals to go either direction

this is not advice to buy or sell but a mixed bag of whats happening and the opinion of a degenerate i love lamp

take care",1300,holding  bags and will be for the foreseeable future laugh out loud,who was pumping bb today  dont do that dont give me hope   at,bb isnt a meme is definitely a meme at this point

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) written a python script that scans the sp stocks and uses rsi bollinger bands and Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) to i identify possible entry points my hope is to build a system thatll flag like  opportunities a week that i can then manually review and decide to buy or not

my goal is relatively short term trading without going into single day trading so holding for a couple days to a couple weeks

thoughts has anyone done this and has recommendations is anyone more experience with technical analysis and willing to give some pointers for indicators that can be relatively easily put into code

or even a good book recommendation to better understand technical analysis would be great i think the script i have now is nice but im sure the algorithm for finding potential entry points could use a lot of tweaking",2,"i wish i knew how to automate ta i use
support resistance and macd the most a script to buy at a bounce off support with macd turned up on week chart and the stock at the lower end of its valuation  thats a good strategy in my opinion one could use stops to mitigate risk although personally i dont use stops",i personally dont put much stock in ta but heres a website that has automated ta,how do you get the data api or manual download

its looking like the downtrend is over and we are in the recovery phase it has been a long  week downtrend but im happy we stopped out at  usd and have a green week we got above  nicely and now its  we are fighting for a lot of open interest at  so i am hopeful that those who have the cash to buy stock will pump it up so tomorrows contracts may be in the money i think we can secure  tomorrow today we are up over  on the lowest volume day weve had in  months crazy people are buying and holding i like that that being said i would not be shocked to see it red tomorrow and retest  rsi is close to overbought on the hourly but the bollinger bands are very tight might be a signal to break out hard to say what happens tomorrow   


why is  significant  
thats where the deadcatfalling knife bounce happened a lot of shares were purchasedsold at that time and it acted as resistance shortly after and again a few days later if  is secured and if we retrace and it acts as support then the bull trend will continue if not then we might be in trouble and could be a false rally 

i dont believe this will happen theres a lot of eyes on bb and their upcoming financials and the latest news about bb working with aws cloud infrastructure in the government in my opinion is a license to print money and institutions wanna know how much money bb received from huwaei and fb  
rsi on the daily and hour charts are looking healthy   
id like the bollinger bands to contract a bit more but hey thats fine with me if it holds the smaller upwards trendline

cybersecurity is a major threat and only gets worse as days go on bb is best in class in this aspect

keep holding my friends youre in a great position if you bought or averaged down in the last week  
take care",170,i am long bb but its hard to know how much we can isolate it both from the meme stock insanity and the forces at play during the recent tech correction after the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) cools a bit i could see it start to bleed again until there is big news,"another day another bb thread

Risk management,stocks,"Instead of having a barrier to entry for unlimited day trading be $25K with the PDT rule, why not replace it with a risk management test?",just because a person has k in their account does not mean they are competent in risk management and wont be stupid with it the pattern day trading rule does nothing but prevent lower class and middle class people from being able to have unlimited day trades and does not even prevent the stupidity it was meant to after it was passed after the dotcom bubble,35,"this pdt rule is also a way of restraining the brokers

the only goal your broker has is making you click the buy and sell button as many times as possible in order to rack up commissions back in the day when i created my ibkr account from a reseller i entered a busy period at work and was getting phone calls why my account was showing little activity the whole point of providing the trading platform is not to help you but to make it as easy as possible to click buy and sell if there was no pdt rule you would see Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS) everywhere daytrade with  etc pretty much what was going on with cfd brokers in europe back in the day

pdt rule makes sure that if you are taking a lot of risk at least you have the funds to back it up which i dont necessarily disagree with if you dont have k in your account you actually have very little means to do any sort of daytrading without taking risks that i would call outrageous",you cant get trapped if you can trade its part of the trap,"just because a person has k in their account does not mean they are competent in risk management and wont be stupid with it 

not defending the pdt rule but based on this reasoning the natural conclusion wouldnt be to remove the rule but to increase the limit even higher

for me risk management means to have a balance between risky lowmidcap stocks in emerging markets stocks and established stocks that you know have a small chance of falling tremendously fast moreover it means stop loss management and a bit of market timing

am i completely wrong does risk management mean something else what does it mean for you",4,deleted,"it depends on what youre doing on a position level it means do you have a plan in place to limit losses if the position goes worst case against you on a portfolio level it means are all you positions going to do poorly at the same time

if your position is long shares then having stop loss order in place isnt a bad approach but if its a limit order and the share price blows past the limit then your order might not fill and youre stuck holding until you go in and change the limit if its a market order than you dont really know what price it will execute at so your risk becomes a little hazy","to me it is synonymous with diversification lets say you only have weed stocks and suddenly the law changes you might lose a lot of money

cons

figs relies heavily on wordofmouth advertising which can be a blessing and   figs only recently achieved profitability and may not maintain profitability in the future additionally the recent rapid growth may not be sustainable or indicative of future growth and they expect the growth rate to ultimately slow over time shipping is a critical part of the business and changes can adversely affect operations  there is reliance on a limited number of thirdparty suppliers to provide material for and produce products which could cause problems in the supply chain  figs also operates within a highly competitive market with  employees and  for the medium term  of figs include

 uniform advantage m in revenue  employees

conclusion

given the recent ipo i expect there to be some price movement and for it to drop in the upcoming weeks  i will wait for a better reentry price  with that said healthcare apparel continuously needs to be replenished resulting in highly predictable recurring demand  figs has room to grow over the next  years and i like it as a longer term investment

Risk management,stocks,How do you manage risk in your portfolio?,"asked this in rinvesting a couple weeks ago and got a lot of good answers curious how the thought process here will be different with the focus on individual stocks and not just index funds

is there a good way to measure how risky your current portfolio is iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) looked at indicators like beta sharpe ratio and sortino ratio in the past but im not sure how to actually use it to manage my portfolio
are there other indicators for things like interest rate risk or is managing risk really just about understanding the individual companies and sectors youre invested in

for example i bought twlo at  and at one point it was one of my top performers and made up  of my portfolio now iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) lost  on that position and im kicking myself for not taking any profits off the table obviously hindsight is  but im interested in how rstocks would have managed this position",15,"diversification  different industries different regions i have  in asia some commodities i have  in gold  stocks instead of just a few 
 dollar cost averaging this spreads your money out during a large period of time so that youll never be caught putting it all in during high points  times in a row
 taking a value approach over just chasing growth stocks and if you do chase growth stocks then rebalance your portfolio with safer choices maybe  growth  value adjust it based on your risk tolerance and remember growth is often just an unprofitable shitty company and value stocks can often have more growth potential
 have hedges against the market you should have holdings that beat the market when it dips for example insurance tends to do well during tough times and will beat the market during bear markets stocks like Procter & Gamble Company (The) (PG) but dont buy them when theyre overvalued do well because the needed products brk seems to be a decent hedge nowadays always holding a bit of gold dalio recommends something like 
 dont panic sell buy more during tough times
 allocate a higher  to your top conviction picks and a lower  to your lower conviction plays some people select the same  for all their picks this makes no sense
 do your research the main thing you should learn is how to look at the companys finances and figure out metrics like roic stock buy backs evebitda pe ratio average yearly revenue or cashflow growth

or just buy etfs the above is advice for individual stock holders im  individual","in my opinion a significant portion of a portfolio should be in voo or a range of other broad etfs so that at least if all your picks go to shit you can come close to capturing the market return the purpose of picking individual stocks is then fold  its super fun  an opportunity to put extra cash in companies you really love and believe in for the long haul and  the returns can potentially add on top of the overall market return

for this reason i hold a small number of individual names  that i can really stay on top of pay attention to their earnings figure out how macroeconomics impacts each etc i think this approach may help you

for example with such constant attention given to twlo maybe you would have had the chance to sit down and say hey this is significantly outpacing where i think it should be im going to take a bit off the table or conversely when it drops you can fall back on the fact that you have super high conviction in the company and this was meant to be for the long haul anyways if nothing fundamentally has changed dont worry at all",i just stay away from buying single names i stick to etfs it makes the portfolio more manageable while maintaining diversification

Risk management,stocks,Investing in developing countries and managing risks and currency volatility,"dear redditors

i have a question for those of you with experience investing in stock markets of developing countries perhaps you reside in one of these countries and possess firsthand experience in your day trading activities specifically im referring to countries grappling with significant inflation rates and erratic currency fluctuations how do you perceive investing in stocks in such countries in terms of risk assessment ranging from mild to a stayaway level

for instance the argentine peso experienced a consistent increase in exchange rates from january to midaugust going from approximately  to about  during the same period the marvel index surged from around k to roughly k representing a gain of about  however the devaluation of the currency by the government from approximately  to about  after midaugust was far from favorable

a similar scenario unfolded in turkey from july to almost the end of september the currency depreciated from  to  indicating a  loss in its value conversely the Borsa İstanbul (BIST) index witnessed an upward trend rising from about k to roughly k marking a  increase

in both these countries one can observe a pattern in the exchange rate behavior where it remains steady for a while experiences sudden spikes plateaus and then stabilizes for a period before spiking again its as if the government decides to adjust the bar a little higher one morning while sipping their coffeeof course the reality is more complex the point is the highly unpredictable nature of the risks involved how do investors manage these risks in such countries",2,if you cant have boots on the ground and physically check out these companies then you have no business investing in them far too risky and relying on rd party accounting is spotty at best,nan,nan
Risk management,stocks,How do you balance patience and risk management?,"im having a hard time capitalizing on full gains for example today i made  on a position but only sold because of sketchy consolidation then the stock proceeded to rise another  after the consolidation ended the difference in time was about  minutes but i had already walked away from trading for the day

i want to hold out and see what happens but i obviously want to be green how do you guys balance this",5,have a target price once it reaches that level exit and dont worry if the stock rockets to the moon otherwise you will be far too emotional,i  stay away from the what could have been and stick to my plan i make x  and ill make more with other stocks even if a stock rose after i sold it ill do a bit of analysis of myself on each trade and then i dont look back whenever i do and start second guessing myself i make mistakes,make a plan and atick with it
Market trends,stocks,"WWE stock hits 52-week high, defying market trends, in aftermath of McMahon scandal","is defying broader market trends this year

the companys stock is up more than  in  hitting a week high monday and trading at levels it hasnt seen since summer  the sp  by comparison is down more than  this year

the stocks strong performance this year occurred as wwes live wrestling events business came roaring back after months of  restrictions and the company increasingly became the subject of sale talks the stock continued to do well after wwes longtime leader and biggest shareholder vince mcmahon  over the summer in a cloud of scandal

shares of wwe were effectively flat monday after hitting  the companys market capitalization is more than  billion

industry insiders believe wwe could be  a deal could come before the companys next us Grupo Televisa S.A. (TV) rights renewal  likely to be announced in mid wwes current us streaming deal with nbcuniversals peacock expires in 

analyst john healy of northcoast research who covers wwe sees the stocks success as a confluence of successful ratings upcoming media deal opportunities and the speculation about a possible acquisition

that speculation has been going on for a long time and i think will always be around this company given the unique asset that it is and the ownership structure healy told cnbc on monday

he also noted that wwe is relatively insulated from consumer trends saying that twothirds of the revenue is coming from lockedin relationships with media companies given a highly saturated media market healy expects high bidding for the rights to raw and smackdown which are set to be renegotiated in the coming year

wwe has also had to deal with mcmahons controversies he retired in july after it was revealed that he had paid nearly  million in previously unrecorded expenses

 almost  million went to settle sexual misconduct allegations from four women against mcmahon over the last  years and  million went to donald trumps foundation from donations made in  and 

wwe has hinted that the hush money payments to alleged victims already the subject of an ongoing independent review overseen by the companys board are under investigation by other entities

still wwe stayed in the family stephanie mcmahon mcmahons daughter took over as chairwoman and coceo alongside nick khan the companys former president stephanies husband and longtime wrestler paul triple h levesque has taken over as the companys top creative executive the role the elder mcmahon had before he retired

one random question im curious about stemming from this weeks market downturn most wealth is held by baby boomers im guessing this is true in stocks when the market looks like its headed into a longterm downturn are they more willing to sell and affect the market since they are older and cashing out their retirements 

if true is there any plan for this now that boomers are well into retirement age it would seem that one of the next recessions could be the last one theyre willing to weather and theyll all dip out",4,"most baby boomers are already out  theyre  years old and retired or nearing retirement so they are in riskoff mode for the most part  so this sell and cash out thing has mostly happened with that generation already  


anyone who was still invested in the broader market with retirement money is probably young enough to weather this storm","most wealth is held by baby boomers

older people tend to have more wealth boomers or not because theyve had more time to accumulate it and peak earning years are typically the s 

when the market looks like its headed into a longterm downturn are they more willing to sell and affect the market since they are older and cashing out their retirements 

potentially but its not like everyone is going to be selling all the same things at all the same time a certain percentage of boomers are going to be invested more conservatively less stocks and more bonds so they might be doing some of the selling 

it would seem that one of the next recessions could be the last one theyre willing to weather and theyll all dip out

anyone reaching retirement age in america today is likely to live another  years they cant all go  bonds theyll need some stocks for growth over the years and some higherincome people plan on not even using their roth iras because they have no minimum distribution ks require you to start taking out money at a certain age  or  but roth iras have no requirement and can be used for inheritances",most of the wealth is held by institutions not individuals retail investors make up a very small proportion of the overall money in the market
Market trends,stocks,"let's be real. if a megacap stock drops 50%, 99% of y'all wouldn't touch it","its intriguing how recent market trends like metas dramatic drop and subsequent recovery reflect investor psychology more than rational analysis earlier this year meta was trading at a  discount from its alltime high and the general sentiment was overwhelmingly negative akin to buying blockbuster stock in 

however following its near  rise from that low point perceptions have shifted drastically this flipflop in attitude underlines a critical aspect of investing market sentiment is often driven by emotion rather than fundamentals if meta or any big name for that matter dropped by  again history suggests that the majority of investors would shy away not jump in

this pattern is a classic example of the behavioral economics at play in the stock market where fear and greed often override logical decisionmaking its why individual stock picking especially based on market dips can be so risky and unpredictable it demonstrates the value of a more diversified steady approach like investing in index funds which is likely a more suitable strategy for the majority of investors",920,"everyone is looking at the winners but why no one is making similar posts for losers

its easy to see meta as successful example since it recovered so fast but what if sentiment remained bearish and stock was still tradings below s

to directly answer your question right now isnt the worst time we are coming off a deflated bubble from last year but in no way are we cheap historically speaking so in other words it can go both ways but odds are you will not get killed if you bought today

a good metric to use is the sp pe you can find it here 

as you can see we are sitting at about  pe which isnt horrible like during the bubbles but isnt low either id say its about average for the last  years or so it could go down if everything goes wrong with the economy unemployment goes way up while inflation stays way up it can definitely go up if inflation is tackled before unemployment goes up much

no one knows where unemployment will be by end of next year we know jobs will be lost but its unknown if that will outweigh all the job openings that are unfilled but i think most will agree that inflation will cool off due to slowing economy from here your guess is as good as anyone elses","its a good time to invest but not the best time for growth stocks that dominate voo Vanguard Total Stock Market VIPERs (VTI) and qqq

Market trends,stocks,Are market trends intrinsic or are they a result of buying/selling patterns created by people?,"iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) started to get into charting and such and i was wondering wether trendspatterns are intrinsic they just happen because they happen or if they are only there because people know about them and make decisions based on the particular pattern 

for example bull or bear flags when a stock breaks through the bottomtop is it only doing so as a result of a large amount of people buyingselling because they have identified that pattern and anticipate it moving one way or the other or does the stock break through merely because that is the path it takes

im not sure if this makes sense or not any insight would be much appreciated",20,on the long term like over the course of quarters or years its almost all about the fundamental value of the company over the short term like hours to weeks theres a lot of psychology at play i would suggest ignoring all but the most basic forms of technical analysis support and resistance in favor of learning about fundamentals and how to value a company when technical analysis works its either luck or a self fulfilling prophecy because other people are assuming it will work and buying and selling accordingly,they are completely just the result of the buying and selling done by the people that being said that buying and selling is usually heavily based on intrinsic value however the market will never match this intrinsic value as long as humans have emotions and different ways of determining value,no one knows all guesswork

Economic indicators,stocks,"Unveiling the Economic Puzzle: Change in Rate Expectations, and Economic Indicators.","over the past two weeks a comprehensive set of economic data has provided economists and investors with a detailed understanding of the us economy notably todays market reversal was driven by a shift in market expectations for the federal reserves target rate presenting a challenging path forward for the stock market and raising uncertainties

the latest labor market data revealed a hint of tepidness in the june nonfarm payrolls report job growth of  fell slightly below consensus expectations and revisions showed a net gain of  jobs signaling a slower pace compared to previous months this suggests that the ongoing reduction in the m measure of money is gaining traction and beginning to impact the economy tight monetary policy as a result of the federal reserves hiking cycle is starting to have an effect

despite the softer labor market data it is unlikely to deter the federal reserve from raising shortterm interest rates at the upcoming july  meeting civilian employment including smallbusiness startups rose by  pushing the unemployment rate down to  average hourly earnings increased and total hours worked saw an uptick reinforcing the belief that the fed perceives the need for further stabilization of the economy through additional rate hikes

a divergence becomes apparent when shifting focus to the goods and services sectors the ism manufacturing index continued its contraction for the eighth consecutive month reflecting concerns about a slowing us economy and reduced customer demand in contrast the ism services index rose to  in june with fifteen out of eighteen major industries reporting growth surpassing even the most optimistic forecasts while signs of a potential recession loom the services side of the economy appears to be holding up for now with business activity and new orders within the services sector remaining in expansion territory

international trade data indicated a decline in the trade deficit for goods and services to  billion in may accompanied by decreases in both imports and exports this aligns with forecasts of a recession reflecting weakened domestic demand for goods and a shift towards increased spending on services import numbers from china have plummeted by  compared to the same period last year resulting in china slipping to the thirdlargest exporter to the us behind mexico and canada falling daily freight rates further indicate a weakened global trade environment

the most significant market impact today was driven by new expectations for the federal reserves target rate the provided data reveals an increasing probability now at  of the target rate falling within the  basis points range this shift in rate expectations has led investors to reassess their strategies and pricing models incorporating the potential impact on various asset classes

though rates off recent highs this weeks stilllarge backup in yields reflects fears of a more aggressive fed and continued global tightening though market pricing continues to forecast only a single july rate hike before the fed pauses

considering the implications for the stock market the outlook appears uncertain the ongoing slowdown in the goods sector coupled with reduced demand and inventory buildup raises concerns about future factory output persistent inflationary pressures as indicated by the prices index within the manufacturing sector pose challenges for companies

as the market adjusts to shifting rate expectations and economic indicators caution should be exercised the stock market may face downward pressure as it navigates these uncertainties potentially impacting company valuations and investor sentiment market participants are urged to closely monitor developments adapt investment strategies accordingly and remain diligent in risk management

the message the worlds top central bankers delivered late last month could not have been clearer bank of england governor andrew bailey and his us and eurozone counterparts jay powell and christine lagarde all insisted that high inflation  and high interest rates  would endure

the impact of the shifting economic landscape and changing rate expectations will mainly impact cyclical stocks stocks particularly sensitive to economic fluctuations cyclical stock industries include automotive construction technology hardware manufacturing consumer durables housing airlines travel and leisure the slowdown in the goods sector coupled with potential rate hikes could present challenges for companies within these sectors",9,july expected inflation yoy is  compared to  last july powell has repeatedly said fed goal is to tame inflation and not create unemployment,the slowdown should mean inflation will go down not necessarily a recession though i think the recession will happen but still several months away at least,how much of the increase in services is due to profit inflation

 jobs report

 why the north star for me is that my companies should be delivering strong results if people are employed making money and spending their money on goods  services that my company provides low unemployment strong job creation and a tight labor market quickly signals to me my companies should continue to do well with a firm economy
 what i look for im very focused on the unemployment rate  number of jobs created k and the labor force participation rate  the labor market is strong which is great for my companies  but my longerterm outlook for unemployment    job creation k and lfpr  is softer to align with demographic trends

 jobless claims

 why i really like to get a weekly thursday update on how many people are filing for unemployment so i can get timely  highfrequency update on how the labor market is doing a strong labor market is very important so my companies can sustain demand and deliver strong results
 what i look for the precovid average is  claims so anything below or around this level means the labor market is strong and gives me an indicator that the monthly jobs report should be strong as well

 materials released from the federal reserve like fomc projections fomc minutes fomc announcement and fed chair press conference

 why theyre professional economists have more resources and connections than i do to understand how the economy is doing  where its going i learn a lot from their expertise and try to make sure im on the same page on my understanding of the economy so i know where monetary policy and interest rates are going
 what i look for my favorite thing to look for is their fomc projections since they share their forecasts for economic growth  unemployment rate  inflation  in the longterm and interest rates another  bps by the end of the year

 inflation

 why the federal reserve looks at inflation to determine if interest rates should go up or down if inflation is too high the federal reserve will increase interest rates tighten monetary policy and will negatively impact stock prices regardless of how well my companies perform
 what i look for i look at pce since the federal reserve wants that to average around  for stable inflation and i also look at cpi cpi is available earlier than pce and has recently been pp higher than pce i expect pce to be  for may  since cpi for may  was  not good compared to the feds target of  for inflation

 why  strong business activity in a country translates to higher profits for my companies its an important metric as an investor for that reason but low on my list because gdp released from the bea isnt timely at all its released quarterly im already making decisions as an investor way after this is released and there are a lot of noisy components that affects the headline number that has no impact on my companies thats why i like to see the realtime gdp forecast from the atlanta fed since their model is built similarly to how gdp is measured and the model really helps me understand how numerous data points that are released over time will impact gdp like home sales manufacturing indexes and other data points that are tough to make investment decisions on their own

Economic indicators,stocks,[Forbes] Are we in a recession?,"experts have been talking about a us recession for close to a year now but with no official announcement the debate continues here is an update based on the most recent economic reports to help better understand where the economy currently sits and if a recession is still on the horizon

definition of a recession

a drop in output across all leading economic indicators defines a recession more specifically if employment levels drop consumer spending decreases and industries dont produce as much as they did previously these areas of economic activity have to be in a longterm decline for there to be an official call a definitive recession

even though the final monthly and quarterly numbers of these activities are used to determine a recession theyre not always representative of the state of the economy the national bureau of economic research nber is the agency that calls a recession whenever it notes that economic indicators are showing continued signs of a slowdown

in the past the nber would call a recession after two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product gdp what makes things different this time is that other economic indicators still showed strength during the same contraction period this forced the nber to reassess



edit the response has been crazyi thought that we are not in a recession according to everyone on reddit",332,all this handwringing over technical definition vs rule of thumb but just keep in mind it is okay to debate Brunswick Corporation (BC) often times we will not have a declared recession till it is almost over laugh out loud therefore it could be early in one without it being official,people still debate when the early s recession technically began  i think all the arguing over verbiage just gets us distracted from the issue,i declarerecession

theres been eviction moratoria in various forms in the us for nearly a year now and the numbers of people delinquent in either are rising  yet the market keeps going up even in retail companies  were seeing a dip right now due to various things like rising bond yields stimulus package wavering and negotiation trade wars in semiconductors leading to a knockon effect of decreased production in automotive and asian and european markets having their own issues  meme stocks are still flailing about with strange correlations not just to each other but with the market overall theres something here that also concerns me but thats for another post

the jobs report for february was quite positive  more jobs decreased unemployment  

nonfarm payrolls  vs  expected and a revised  in january
unemployment rate  vs  expected and  in january
average hourly earnings monthovermonth  vs  expected and a revised  in january
average hourly earnings yearoveryear  vs  expected and a revised  in january

personal disposable income lept in january by  compared to the previous month  

since a lot of income and spending numbers are relative to gdp we can see that there was a massive drop q  and regained only  of that drop in the following quarter  we havent recovered that initial drop yet not by a long shot  q didnt help much 

us gdp dropped expectedly in  by 

 currentdollar gdp decreased  percent or  billion in  to a level of  trillion compared with an increase of  percent or  billion in  tables  and  

 measured from the fourth quarter of  to the fourth quarter of  real gdp decreased  percent during the period table  that compared with an increase of  percent during  

now with mortgage and rent things arent good

  of americans had outstanding housing payments at the beginning of august  aug  

 more than  million us households missed their rent or mortgage payment in september  oct  

 more than  of americans didnt pay rent mortgage in december  february  

these articles and more all have the same theme  people are behind on home payments even if only partially

theres also a persistent expectation of loss of employment income with  with weekly data for  weeks raw data available for download  theres a nice map there that breaks things down by state and by metro area  a common theme here is large nonfarm employment hubs like la miami new york boston detroit chicago dallas houston atlanta san diego and nevada where i suspect las vegas and reno are getting hit hard since theyre heavy tourism and service sectors  these expectation percentages are large in leading metro areas

theres  on mortgage data that appears mixed  two bullet points demonstrate this

 the national mortgage delinquency rate fell to  in january dropping below  for the first time since march 

 at the current rate of improvement  million mortgages will still be seriously delinquent at the end of june when foreclosure moratoriums on governmentbacked loans are currently slated to lift

a large concern is the moratorium extension biden issued on january st  the extension moves the expiration from march st to june st  the reason its a concern is because its only for mortgages not also rent

 the white house said the extended protections are in part aimed at prioritizing communities of color hit hardest by the pandemic homeowners of color make up a disproportionate share of the home owners with delinquent loans or on forbearance plans 

 however tuesdays actions did not address the centers for disease control and preventions federal moratorium on evictions for not paying rent that moratorium is also set to expire march  about onethird of all americans roughly  million people are renters 

we keep pushing these quarterly moratoria out by one quarter and im not sure what politicians are expecting to happen inside three months that will address this situation to a sufficient degree  debt is debt and people getting their jobs back doesnt mean that debt goes away instantly  

the service sector is the largest nonfarm sector in the us economy by employment   that sector has also gotten kicked square in the balls by the pandemic  the fact that the service sector pays crap to most of its employees means that they have a really hard time building up emergency funds and are therefore likely to be small  with an extended period of reduced wages or just plain unemployment means that most of those emergency funds will have likely been drained by now

thats a long way of saying there are lots of lowincome folks on the edge of eviction with no help whatsoever in sight  from the bloomberg article above on february   

 some  million jobs were lost last year and the us suffered the sharpest rise in the poverty rate since the s

bash a bear all you want i dont see any other interpretation of this data other than politicians refusing to defuse a massive economic time bomb

that does not mean that there wont be growth in sectors  i just dont like the fact that i just now seriously considered for a few minutes getting into a payday loan etf theyve somewhat flatlined which im actually thankful for maybe due to various statelevel legislation in recent years limiting their collective growth potential

if  was to avoid a crash in march  they succeeded  im no economist so i cant critique one way or the other if it was the smart thing to do but we cant deny the effects that its going to have  increased inflation  its possible that the intent was to turn a crash into inflation which the fed can manage better but its not clear if really they just dumped money into the economy only to save the stock market with near complete disregard for the longterm effects  weve heard jpow say their policy has been adjusted inflation targets to average  per year but naturally that implies at least one year of   inflation likely more  if an economist or two can lend some insight here as to their intent and potential mitigation strategies it would be extremely helpful  i worry that the party will be over when they transition to finite qe

the picture is far more complex than these statistics  as far as calling this E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) its incomplete but im posting it here to get a more indepth conversation started  there are gaps to fill statistics to clarify and simply just more research that needs to be done to get a better picture

personally im not doing this to profit on what could be a gut punch followed by a long slow bleed  i want to have hard data to present to my representatives and tell them what areas need fixing  the only thing i can think of is blanket federal support for gradual home payment debt assistance but a more thorough examination of our current status is needed before i go to my reps with such a heavyhanded solution",8,"youre not offbase here this has been a major concern of mine for some time two points ill bring up

  most of the people who are behind on mortgage payments will be able to work things out with their lenders lenders dont want to foreclose on a property unless absolutely necessary i personally think that a lot of the people behind on their mortgage will negotiate plans to tack on their missed payments to the end of their mortgage essentially just extending the term of the loan this wont help people who rent but i do think it will help reduce the risk of a flood of home foreclosures

  i understand that investing in payday lenders can be profitable but im begging anyone reading not to do so im not too big on esg but payday lenders are the scum of the earth and do not deserve to have capital allocated to them they are just as bad as russian mercenary companies and private prisons",deleted,"not a financial advisor yadda yadda 

i am a commercial lender im having a hard time wrapping my mind around whats going on i happen to deal with a lot of people with large portfolios of rental properties  both apartments and sfrs and to a lesser extent commercial properties across their portfolios they are collecting rent like covid hasnt been an issue also basically non existent vacancy rates past due levels across our bank are crazy low  im sure it has a lot to do with things being pretty good where im at regarding unemployment etc but still no real warning signs going off 

lending in general is competitive but im not seeing overly risky deals being made in the market rates are low and terms are generous if you want business it is at low profit margins

my fear if you want to call it that with the economy is that we are basically in a forever low rate environment people have been conditioned to low rates if a big hiccup comes along and rates go up people dont necessarily have the cash flow to cover it we have been underwriting deals for basically the last  years based on minimum coverage ratios and consumer transactions on dtis with extremely low historical rates people have gotten used to that and use the extra cash flow they were paying in interest expense to buy carsboatsvacations etc and stimulating the economy a rise in rates brings all of that to a halt 

our economy is also largely tied to construction and real estate right now we are seeing home prices appreciating and people are able to afford the mortgages on homes because the rates are low with rates going up and home prices increasing its going to slow the real estate market homes are getting more expensive to build by the day so prices cant be cut to offset the rise in rates at the same time inventory levels are low right now so people are going to keep buying at least for awhile but if rates are higher and cost is higher then people will have to cut back somewhere to afford it reducing their consumption 

i watched a bit of a webinar yesterday where a guy was talking about expectations for mortgage rates economy inflation etc he said we can expect rates to increase for the near term before the fed steps in with something akin to operation twist to pull long term rates down we are bound to see inflation show up in the next couple of months because it is calculated based on a rolling  months in march and april last year we saw negative inflation as those months get rolled off it has to go up before settling back down

costs are definitely goin up so there is undoubtedly inflation out there at the same time wages year over year are up and our govt is flooding the system with money and looks like it will continue to be trickled in over time with the current stimulus package and a likely future infrastructure deal 

in my opinion at all costs rates have to be kept low not sure how that can be done long term but im also not convinced we can handle rising rates 

to be frank im also worried about us pumping so much money into the system and what will happen with taxes i think we will see a lot of cities facing debt issues due to tax collection issues

Economic indicators,stocks,"Nobel Economist Paul Krugman says the economy is doing better than people think and ""those recession calls were clearly a false alarm""","americans are still fretting over a potential recession but the economy is actually faring much better than most people think according to nobel economist paul krugman

in an oped for the new york times on monday krugman pointed to widespread pessimism about the us economy despite indicators that show economic activity is fairly healthy

though  of ceos expect the economy to tip into a recession within the next  months according to the conference boards latest survey krugman noted that the job market is the strongest its been in decades with the us adding  million jobs since december  the unemployment rate has also dropped to its lowest level since the s while job satisfaction is at an alltimehigh

and while inflation was a top concern for americans in  prices have been coming down for much of the past year cooling to  in the april consumer price index report thats over  basispoints lower from where prices where in june  when inflation notched a yearhigh of 

the interesting question now is why at least according to some surveys the public remains very negative on the economy  as negative as it has been in the past amid severe economic downturns  even though those recession calls were clearly a false alarm and the economy is actually looking remarkably strong krugman said 

markets grew particularly skittish about recession risks last year when the us slipped into a technical recession defined by two straight quarters of negative gdp growth

but official recessions are declared by the national bureau of economic research which uses other data to determine if the us is truly in a recession so far those other indicators say that it is not krugman said 

he speculated that the gloomy outlook on the economy stemmed from americans who were assuming others were facing economic difficulties though most people themselves are still dealing with upbeat personal fortunes the odds of a future recession have also been widely publicized through media reports which could be creating a negative bias

while many americans tell surveys that things are terrible  which says something about how people respond to surveys and where they get their information this doesnt contradict positive assessment krugman added

still other experts have warned a downturn is still possible this year as the fed signals it will keep interest rates high bank of america strategists said a downturn could start as soon as this quarter judging by a notorious bond market indicator that predicted the recessions of   and",726,isnt he the guy who is always wrong on an almost jim cramer level,krugman got roasted in the comments section of the ny times   he was lambasted as an affluent professional who is not in touch with ordinary people who cant afford to buy food and pay the rent,"everybody expected a recession its been what  years now

first the sp pe ratio this ratio takes the price of the sp and divides it by the collective earnings of the stocks within the sp it works as an overboughtoversold indicator much like it does on individual stocks currently its  which is maybe slightly high but it is nothing close to estimating that recession is coming the link below will show you sp  pe ratio by month look at the ratio during late  and  it was in the s

Economic indicators,stocks,"Many indicators are suggesting a recession in the near future, what's your opinion?","the yield curve

at the point of closing on friday the us treasury bond yield curve is slightly inverted between the  and  besides the slight inversion the yield curve is generally extremely flat pointing at a high probability for a weak economy in the future if not a recession the yield curve flattening started already last year but became recently only flatter the yield curve inversion is known to be a very accurate predictor of recessions 



the eurodollar futures curve 

the eurodollar futures curve which is a bet on the  months libor started inverting already early last december and is currently inverted from the dec  contract the inversion is only becoming deeper in the later contracts and suggests that there is a high probability that the economic situation in the near future will be such that the fed will be forced to stop hiking rates or even has to lower the rates again the eurodollar futures curve is also an accurate indicator for recessions and predicted the reaction of the fed for the gfc as well as march 



the rising dollar 

since the lows about one year ago the us dollar is rising rapidly on the dxy it is already very close to multi year highs and if it keeps its momentum we could see levels not seen since  years a rising dollar suggests an illiquid dollar shortage situation which isnt any good for the economy 


the rising oil price

i think this one doesnt need much explanation but if the oil price it too high it will damage the economy because it will squeeze out the budget of the people causing to less economic activity for anything else a quickly rising oil price is associated with recessions and this time the oil price is definitely rising very quickly 



high cpi prints

similar to high oil prices if the cpi rises quickly without similarly high rising wages across all income classes the people will be squeezed out in their spending for other stuff and services which is bad for the economy 


i think thats not even everything but at least an overview of important and usually very accurate indicators pointing towards a recession its also very interesting that all the above mentioned indicators were pointing in to the bad direction far before russia started the war and the west reacted with sanctions implying that the situation was developing badly independently from the war obviously the war on the top makes things only worse

but i do know what the stock market is

so here is my question why on earth isnt the nvidia stock going up and up until there is quite literally not enough money in any investors pocket anymore to buy another share

do the people with money not understand whats going on nvidia has  competition and every single one of the richest people on earth is buying as many gpus as they can probably paying doubletriple to get their hardware delivered first this is happening right now as we speak

sooooooo  uhm  do only people that game  actually get what the ai revolution entails isnt it obvious are nerds with  years of experience in their field the only people that can actually tell whats happening like do i have to be a hobby pilot for  years to see when a revolutionary invention is happening in the aerospace industry is everyone else blind to that im confused do people always think they are being tricked when it comes to stocks you could have had a nerdy friend working in machine learning and he could have told you everything thats going down now back in 

if i understand this correctly then the only reason nvidia stock isnt rising every week is because people think they are being tricked by nerdy gamers

update alright thanks everyone for sharing your thoughts really appreciate it to wrap up heres a summary of the reasons why nvidia stock isnt continually rising

now i need the money for a down payment on a first home for my wife and i this ticker has always been in my brokerage account alongside every other trade iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) done it was really hard selling it but i know its exactly why iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been holding it all these years now its giving me the opportunity to afford a home for my family and i am unspeakably grateful 

im fortunate enough that my grandparents are still around and i can tell them myself how much of a gift they gave me all those years ago i kept a few shares for the sentimentality maybe ill pass them down someday too

what is so hilarious about this is that your friend is more likely to be in trouble for you asking than you are now his management team may be able to justify looking into his emails texts etc in order to confirm he is not sharing inside info

trade,stocks,Do people actually day trade successfully?,the way i was taught day trading is the same as gambling youll always lose in the end however there seems to be so many people who just crush it trading every day i know most of these people on socials are full of shit but are there actually people who make bank trading i dont see how that could be possible considering nobody can predict the market,167,i saw a video of a guy showcasing day trading with  dollars by the end of the day he made k profit the next day he took his k into trading and lost it all hopefully that helps,"i made  on a DTE Energy Company (DTE) spy put this morning 

only  more and im back to even","having spent some time in a place where they stake people to day trade this is what it looks like

trade,stocks,What $GME has taught me in 36 hours of day trading,"jumped on the Gamestop Corporation (GME) bandwagon on friday    my  hours of day trading has already taught me that no matter how this plays out i will never you only live once on a bubble ever again

the principle seemed straightforward hedge funds got lazygreedy overshorted their positions bet against a company that wasnt actually going under and some astute monkies on reddit caught them and triggered a short squeeze even as someone who knows almost nothing about the stock market the basic premise makes sense but the devils in the details and hype is blinding

first red flag was when i realized  did not bet on the short squeeze he bet on undervalued stock price over a year ago he has also trimmed his position such that no matter what happens in the squeeze he walks away with  figures so the people screaming if hes still in im still in and look at those brass balls if he can lose mm in a day then i can hold are really living up to the dumb ape meme he didnt lose mm yesterday he lost mm in unrealized gains there is a huge difference

second red flag was a common sense idea that hedge funds wont go down without a fight and they have literally billions of dollars and decades of experience you dont get that without learning how to game the system in complex subtle ways so even if they are still heavily shorted which they might not even be anymore and even if somehow  is holding some kind of meaningful leverage over them that doesnt rule out the very real possibility they have a dozen ways out of this that people like me have no idea about

but even in the off chance that somehow this turns around and Gamestop Corporation (GME) does go to the moon that doesnt change the fact that its bad longterm strategy to bet on bubbles and jump on bandwagons they almost certainly fail and if they dont they only serve to inflate egos that will fall even harder on the next gamble im still holding my shares but i dont expect to see my  ever again in the off chance i break even or see a profit here i will count it as dumb luck and use it as seed money to learn how to invest in real long term gains

edit holy shit rip my inbox no way i can read all that

want to clarify a few things not financial advice

my position i knew i was late to the party i wanted to gamble i knew what i was doing and mostly why i did it hindsight showed me it was more based on emotion than i wanted to admit but still im not surprised by the outcome so far and im totally ok with taking the l and calling it a lesson learned i dont blame dfv wsb or anyone for my choices i own them even proudly because i wanted to step out and take a calculated risk vs sit on the sidelines out of fear of loss im holding because i already bought my tickets to this ride want to see this thing play out and im fine with gambling the final  on the outside chance things turn around

your positions brothers sisters nonbinary siblings you are not your portfolio whether up or down your value is not based on how big or small an imaginary number is you are a human being on the bleeding edge of  billion years of evolution you have more actual success in your past and potential success in your future than youll ever know  years ago i was a penniless alcoholic literally stealing change from my grandpa to get loaded on  steel reserve i hit my bottom joined aa and now im a network engineer wife kids the whole lot anything is possible if you dont give up on yourself but i know its not that easy we all need borrowed selfesteem before we can see the real value inside so if this Gamestop Corporation (GME) gamble hit you hard please reach out to someone dont give up hell this bubble isnt even over it might even turn around but either way dont give up

edit

wow never expected this to go this far wrote it on my way out the door as a way to cope with the situation read a ton of replies probably missed most of them thanks for all the love and hate and everything inbetween a few more points

 agreed that rh deserves to be held accountable no question they manipulated this
 agreed its not over yet the squeeze could happen but if it does my main personal takeaway from this experience will stand i wont speculate on bubbles anymore this is my position if i lose everything or make k
 if you posted gains thats awesome so glad for you i wish you the best

edit 

full disclosure i closed my position this morning at a  realized loss

my gut says the squeeze happened short interest isnt what i thought it was on friday and the stock will return to actual value soon

edit 

i stand by my decisions both to buy and to sell i dont speculate on bubbles period but you can do whatever the fuck you want with your money and youll never find me shaming you about it",26717,"unlike most  i actually watched most of dfvs videos he was never bettering on the short squeeze  he was campaigning for Gamestop Corporation (GME) being around for much longer

wsb was shitting all over him when he was posting his losses up until he started making great profit thats when they all started calling him their god","another good lesson that you performed is to never invest more than you can afford to lose especially on a risky play by going in with just    its easier to look at things from a more objective lens and not fall prey to the hopes hypes and hysteria when the price swings big

trade,stocks,This killed day trading for me..,"i havent told hardly anyone this because it kills me to think about  i had started day trading paper stocks i was reading day trading books by reputable day traders watching live youtube traders and actually was doing pretty good in  year i had turned the original  paper money i started with into  it was like i couldnt lose for every red day i had  green days i was doing everything by the book and it was really working  
   
   so not having any money i took out a personal loan for k put k in the bank and k into my day trading platform i was so confident in myself that i laughed when the loan guy told me  years at  i told him id pay it off in full within  months 

   now in day trading they teach you to look for a catalyst a reason why a stock will go up they also teach you to set a stop loss at no more than  so you dont lose everything if it drops well i started day trading for real and was doing only ok i would make  dollars then lose  dollars lose  then make  i was about  red days and green days my k was down to about  after a week then it happened  i read a stock twit at am about a small company that just had their product approved to sell on amazon i looked it up and it was true i told myself i would buy k worth when i looked up the price it was only  a share

   the bell rings and i buy like  shares it instantly goes up about  percent and im getting excited then literally as im setting my stop loss not even  minutes into the session it drops alot below where my stop was gonna be set im down  so im like well shit i go to set another stop but it falls so fast that i cant set it in time im down  then  then  and im freaking out i finally set a stop and it sells immediately for a  dollar loss this was the first  minutes of the session over the next  minutes it dropped to  a share i thought well at least i got out before it went that low upset and confused about why it would fall so low on positive news i ieft to work i had about a  min drive and decided about  mins into it to check on that stock it was  a share the app for the particular platform at the time was only for checking stocks i could not perform any buysell action from the app and i was driving to work i checked again  mins later it was at  a share i got to the supply house about  mins later and checked while i was waiting on parts  a share i couldnt stop watching it all day so when the market closed and it was at  a share i literally felt sick the next day it fell a bit early but then ended at  dollars 

   over the next two weeks it had massive swings but hit a high of  dollars a share now i dont know if i would have held it to that point but i beat myself up for months thinking i lost  dollars when i could have made k it completely killed my spirit i started sucking at my trades it only took a few months and another almost k in losses for me to lose all motivation and pull out my  bucks i had left and put it in a different stock trading account close my day trading account and completely lose all confidence in my ability to day trade

   they say  of day traders claim a loss at the end of the year i guess i was part of that statistic i went from being on cloud  with my paper account for a year just slaying the market to being completely shut down in just a few months every time someone brings up yo man you still doing the day trading thing i just lie and tell them no i dont have enough time to dedicate to it anymore but really i think of the perfect trade that i knew would go up that i sold for a loss and unable to do anything i watched it go up  and it still makes me physically queasy this was  years ago i am what they call in the business an emotional trader just thinking of day trading for real money now actually gives me anxiety thanks for reading my story  true by the way nothing in this is made up or exaggerated real prices real time frames i just cant remember the ticker 
 
   it ended up falling to about  or  dollars a share over the next year and yes i watched it for the next year but k into k in one day would have been great k into k the next day would have been better  turning it into k would have been life changing for me at that time but i think what hurts the most is that i found that obscure twit i did the research i truly believed it would go up i knew it would go up then i panic sold my perfect trade that was truly perfect thats worse than losing the money


edit ok so i found the stock tickeri was able to log into my tc account from my browser and look at my trade history it was obln i had trouble finding a chart for it for some reason but i did find one the prices are totally different than what they were that day they must have had some splits or reverse splits or something 

   i also got a couple details wrong i didnt buy  shares that was actually a different stock i yolod my whole  dollars and bought  shares at  each on may   another detail i got wrong it wasnt almost  years ago it was almost  years ago i sold  minutes later at  a share it wasnt a  dollar loss it was a  dollar loss according to the only chart i could find that recognized the ticker symbol on may   it opened at  hit a high of  a low of  and closed at  a share exactly the same as the open totally different than what my trade history says there are some other weird things about this stock besides having trouble finding a chart on tc it is now listed as oblnold also my trade history is wonky and not correct i bought all those shares watched it drop and sold them then watched the price skyrocket for the rest of the day according to tc i bought  shares at  which is correct but then it says i sold them all  minutes later for  this is not correct it also shows me buying  shares the next day at  then selling   minutes later for  then selling the other   minutes after that for  none of that happened i never traded it a second day i bought at  then sold a few minutes later at either  or  it was one transaction on one day tc was always a little funky and i grew to not like it all im sure since the chart and my numbers do not match there will still be people saying im lying or this is fake or whatever if those people would like i can send them screen shots of my buy at  on the same day that the chart says it was  i wish it matched but i currently have both up on my computer and i can send them i dont understand it either but i found the ticker yea",2008,biggest mistake was trading money that wasnt yours that makes your trades much more emotional,stocktwits is manipulative pump garbage stay off of there and find another source of leads,"if you sold at the top and netted k it probably would have stoked your confidence and made you more comfortable taking on even riskier behavior and exposing yourself to even greater downsides  just some food for thought  lack of sustainability is a key feature of day trading

trade,stocks,Federal Officials Trade Stock in Companies Their Agencies Oversee,"hidden records show thousands of senior executive branch employees owned shares of companies whose fates were directly affected by their employers actions a wall street journal investigation found

thousands of officials across the governments executive branch reported owning or trading stocks that stood to rise or fall with decisions their agencies made a wall street journal investigation has found

more than  officials at agencies from the commerce department to the treasury department during both republican and democratic administrations disclosed stock investments in companies while those same companies were lobbying their agencies for favorable policies that amounts to more than one in five senior federal employees across  federal agencies reviewed by the journal

a top official at the environmental protection agency reported purchases of oil and gas stocks the food and drug administration improperly let an official own dozens of food and drug stocks on its nobuy list a defense department official bought stock in a defense company five times before it won new business from the pentagon

the journal obtained and analyzed more than  financialdisclosure forms for about  senior career employees political staff and presidential appointees the review spans  through  and includes data on about  financial assets and more than  trades reported in stocks bonds and funds by the officials their spouses or dependent children

the vast majority of the disclosure forms arent available online or readily accessible the review amounts to the most comprehensive analysis of investments held by executivebranch officials who have wide but largely unseen influence over public policy


among the journals findings

 while the government was ramping up scrutiny of big technology companies more than  federal officials reported owning or trading at least one of four major tech stocks meta platforms Suncor Energy (Inc.) facebook alphabet Suncor Energy (Inc.) google apple Suncor Energy (Inc.)and amazoncom inc

 more than five dozen officials at five agencies including the federal trade commission and the justice department reported trading stock in companies shortly before their departments announced enforcement actions such as charges and settlements against those companies

 more than  senior epa officials nearly one in three reported investments in companies that were lobbying the agency epa employees and their family members collectively owned between  and nearly  million in shares of oil and gas companies on average each year between  and 

 at the defense department officials in the office of the secretary reported collectively owning between  million and  million of stock in aerospace and defense companies on average each year examined by the journal some held stock in chinese companies while the us was considering blacklisting the companies

 about  federal officials reported using riskier financial techniques such as short selling and options trading with some individual trades valued at between  million and  million in all the forms revealed more than  trades of stocks during the sixyear period reviewed

 when financial holdings caused a conflict the agencies sometimes simply waived the rules in most instances identified by the journal ethics officials certified that the employees had complied with the rules which have several exemptions that allow officials to hold stock that conflicts with their agencys work
number of federal officials who reported owning specific tech stocks 

federal agency officials many of them unknown to the public wield immense power and influence over things that impact the daytoday lives of everyday americans such as public health and food safety diplomatic relations and regulating trade said don fox an ethics lawyer and former general counsel at the us agency that oversees conflictofinterest rules

he said many of the examples in the journal analysis clearly violate the spirit behind the law which is to maintain the publics confidence in the integrity of the government

some federal officials use investment advisers who direct their stock trading but such trades still can create conflicts under the law the buck stops with the official said kathleen clark a law professor and former ethics lawyer for the washington dc government its the official who could benefit or be harmed that can occur regardless of who made the trade

investing by federal agency officials has drawn far less public attention than that of lawmakers congress has long faced criticism for not prohibiting lawmakers from working on matters in which they have a financial interest the rules were tightened in  by the stop trading on congressional knowledge stock act passed following a series of journal articles on congressional trading abuses

journal reporting last year on federal judges revealing that more than  jurists heard cases in which they had a financial interest led to a law passed this may requiring judges to promptly post online any stock trades they make

this article launches a journal series on the financial holdings of senior executivebranch employees and in some instances conflicts of interest hidden in their disclosure forms

us law prohibits federal officials from working on any matters that could affect their personal finances additional regulations adopted in  direct federal employees to avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest

the  ethics in government act requires senior federal employees above a certain pay level to file annual financial disclosures listing their income assets and loans the financial figures are reported in broad dollar ranges

a view of washington dc

most officials financial disclosures are public only upon request the journal obtained disclosure forms by filing written requests with each federal agency

some made it difficult to obtain the forms and several agencies havent turned over all of them the department of homeland security hasnt provided any financial records see an accompanying article on methodology

under federal regulations investments of  or less in individual stocks arent considered potential conflicts nor are holdings of  or less in mutual funds that focus on a specific industry the law doesnt restrict investing in diversified funds

some federal officials especially those at the most senior levels sell all their individual stocks when they enter the government to avoid the appearance of a conflict

the office of government ethics which oversees the conflictofinterest rules across the executive branch is committed to transparency and citizen oversight of government said a spokeswoman she said the agency publishes financial disclosures of the most senior officials on its website along with instructions for getting disclosures from other agencies

at the epa an official named michael molina and his husband owned oil and gas stocks while mr molina was serving as senior adviser to the deputy epa administrator according to agency records such companies stood to benefit from former president donald trumps pledge to promote energy production by rolling back environmental regulations and speeding up projects

mr molinas job gave him a frontrow seat to deliberations about environmental regulations relating to energy he reviews and coordinates sensitive reports documents and other materials said his job description provided by the epa in response to a publicrecords request he served as a personal and confidential representative of the epa deputy administrator in communications with the white house and congress according to the job description

in the month he started the job may  mr molina reported purchases totaling between  and  of stock in cheniere energy Suncor Energy (Inc.)a leading producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas he reported adding cheniere stock five additional times over the next year at the time senior epa officials were encouraging the production of natural gas in the us

reported trades in energy and mining firms

made by spouse through a financial adviser

the trades were made through a financial adviser in his husbands account according to emails and disclosure forms reviewed by the journal mr molina was required to enter the trades into the epas electronicdisclosure system within  days of receiving notice of the transactions under the  stock act

officials are responsible for ensuring that their holdings dont conflict with their work regardless of whether they use a financial adviser the journals review of disclosures shows that many federal officials tell their financial advisers to avoid investing in certain industries or to shed specific stocks

in an interview on sept  mr molina indicated that he didnt know much about the energy trades i can say this on the record i didnt even know what cheniere was until  hours ago he said

in february  mr molina was promoted to epa deputy chief of staff he attended scores of meetings on environmental issues reviewed matters for the thenhead of the agency andrew wheeler and was sometimes asked his opinions in meetings according to records reviewed by the journal and people familiar with the matter

in about  years at the epa mr molina reported more than  trades in energy and mining companies including duke energy corp nextera energy Suncor Energy (Inc.)and BP p.l.c. (BP) plc about  of the transactions were for between  and  each according to mr molinas disclosures those trades also were made for his husband by his financial adviser

in the month he was promoted february  his husband made several stock purchases through the adviser in cheniere and williams cos which builds and operates naturalgas pipelines

two months later mr trump said the epa would propose new rules to help the gas industry

after publication of this article mr molina said in a written statement neither i nor my husband knew about or directed any of these trades our financial advisor had complete discretion to trade in the account and these same trades were made on behalf of a pool of several dozen clientsnot for us individually

mr molina left the epa in january  an epa spokeswoman said the agencys ethics office counseled mr molina on his ethics and financial disclosure obligations epa officials signed mr molinas financialdisclosure statement in each year he worked at the agency an indication they believed he was in compliance with the conflictofinterest rules

us law leaves it to individual agencies to decide whether they need rules to beef up the federal conflictofinterest law the federal energy regulatory commission explicitly bars its officials from investing in natural gas interstate oil pipeline utility and other energy firms

the epa doesnt have additional agencywide rules a spokeswoman for the epa said its officials may invest in energy companies so long as they arent working on policies that could affect their investments mr molinas boss told ethics officials that he had no influence over public policy matters

greg zacharias was the chief scientist for the defense departments director of operational test and evaluation until last fall he repeatedly bought stock in a defense contractor in the weeks before the pentagon announced it would pay the company  billion to deliver more f combat jets while his division was overseeing testing of those planes

mr zacharias made five purchases of lockheed martin corp stock collectively worth  in august and september  according to figures he provided on sept   the defense department said it was buying  f jets from lockheed for the air force and marine corps lockheed shares closed up  the next trading day the stock made up a small part of mr zachariass portfolio

mr zachariass office had been involved for years in overseeing testing of combat jets and testing officials regularly met with the pentagons f joint program office and with lockheed directly according to former defense officials mr zacharias who provided scientific and technical expertise on how to assess the effectiveness of weapons systems didnt attend those meetings

in an interview mr zacharias said he wasnt involved in decisions on contracting and had no inside knowledge ahead of the contract beyond the public information that the pentagon remained committed to the f program he acknowledged that his role could have allowed him to access information about specific weapons systems i could always walk downstairs and ask them how its going but that really wasnt an interest of mine he said adding that his focus was emerging technologies

mr zacharias said he wanted to buy stock in defense contractors including lockheed because of their dominance of the defense market he said he didnt pay much attention to the timing of trades adding im just the pipesmoking science guy

the lockheed investments were among more than  trades mr zacharias reported in about a halfdozen defense contractors in  and  according to the journals analysis

i apologize that things dont look good on the buy side mr zacharias added of the trades in defense contractors he said i just decided that would be a good investment at the time

he said ethics officials didnt raise concerns about his trades in lockheed or any of the other defense contractors he reported investments in beyond periodically sending a letter reminding him not to take part in contract negotiations involving the companies he said ethics rules could be a little tighter

a pentagon spokeswoman said mr zacharias worked with his supervisor and ethics officials to implement appropriate disqualifications she said the department requires supervisors to screen their employees disclosures for conflicts in addition to the review conducted by ethics officials ethics officials certified that he complied with the law

some conflicts of interest stemmed from agencies misunderstanding of their own rules

the fda prohibits employees their spouses and their minor children from investing in companies that are significantly regulated by the agency the fda maintains an online list of the prohibited companies for officials to check

an fda official named malcolm bertoni disclosed that he and his wife owned stock in about  pharmaceutical diagnostics medical device and food companies regulated by the agency in  and  including drug giants pfizer Suncor Energy (Inc.)and takeda pharmaceutical company Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD) all were on the prohibited list

mr bertoni a career executive ran the fdas planning office from  to  researching and analyzing agency programs most of the investments he reported were in the range of  to  but his  disclosure showed he and his wife owned between  and  in each of allergan plc sanofi sa takeda and zoetis inc

mr bertonis lawyer charles borden said mr bertoni and his wife held these stocks despite the bans because they got bad advice from the fda ethics office

the stocks were in accounts managed by professionals who had discretion to trade without the knowledge of mr bertoni or his wife the attorney said he said that years ago mr bertoni asked the ethics office how he should treat the accounts and was told they fell into an exception to the rules for mutual funds

they did not the ethics office discovered its error in a routine review of mr bertonis forms in early  mr borden said the fdas office of ethics and integrity took full responsibility for the inaccurate guidance given to mr bertoni the attorney said in an email

after considering the tax and retirementplanning consequences of having to sell the stocks and other personal factors mr bertoni chose to retire instead his lawyer said

an fda spokesman said mr bertoni was recused from matters involving the companies once he reported his familys holdings in them the spokesman declined to comment on the events leading up to his departure

the fda takes seriously its obligation to help ensure that decisions made and actions taken by the agency and its employees are not nor appear to be tainted by any question of conflict of interest said the spokesman

when federal officials are found to have violated conflicts rules and are referred to criminal authorities they often receive light punishment if any according to records reviewed by the journal

valerie hardymahoney a lawyer who runs the national labor relations boards oakland califbased regional office held tesla Suncor Energy (Inc.)shares as her office pursued complaints against the auto maker and chief executive elon musk and considered whether to file more

members of the labor relations board appointed by the president review decisions made by agency administrative courts Morgan Stanley (MS) hardymahoney acts as a prosecutor in those courts she is a career employee who joined the nlrb in the s

Morgan Stanley (MS) hardymahoneys office filed complaints against tesla in  and  she reported holding tesla shares worth  to  in  while those cases were ongoing the next year her disclosure form shows she owned tesla shares valued at between  and  in etrade accounts she purchased two chunks of tesla stock in august  each valued at between  and  according to her disclosure form

the nlrb ruled in march  that tesla had illegally fired an employee involved in union organizing and that mr musk in a tweet had coerced employees by threatening them with the loss of stock options if they unionized it ordered tesla to reinstate the employee and mr musk to delete the tweet tesla has disputed the findings and has appealed the decision to a federal appeals court

Morgan Stanley (MS) hardymahoneys office has in other cases rejected charges against tesla filed by employees including allegations her office received in  after she bought more tesla stock according to an nlrb case docket an employee who worked at the tesla gigafactory alleged that the company interfered with workers rights Morgan Stanley (MS) hardymahoneys office dismissed the charge in january 

last november an nlrb ethics official declined to certify that Morgan Stanley (MS) hardymahoney was in compliance with ethics laws and regulations according to her disclosure form

the nlrbs inspector general said in a report that his office had substantiated an allegation of violating federal law by participating in a matter in which an employee had a financial interest an agency spokeswoman confirmed that the report involved Morgan Stanley (MS) hardymahoney

the report said that the matter was referred to the local us attorneys office but that federal prosecutors declined to take it the report said the subject of the reportms hardymahoneyreceived additional training regarding financial conflicts of interest and the case was closed

Morgan Stanley (MS) hardymahoney declined to comment she recused herself from tesla cases last year and now is in compliance with conflictofinterest rules the nlrb spokeswoman said

at the federal reserve an economist named min wei reported trades in stock of a marijuana company after the fed sought clarity about whether banks could serve cannabis businesses a fed spokeswoman said the trades were made by Morgan Stanley (MS) weis husband

in june  fed chairman jerome powell said publicly that the issue put the central bank in a very very difficult position even though its mandate has nothing to do with marijuana mr powell said he just would love to see a clear policy on the matter

because mr powell didnt dismiss the idea investors saw the comment as bullish for cannabis companies such as tilray brands Suncor Energy (Inc.)a leading producer tilray went public the following month and its stock skyrocketed

in early september  Morgan Stanley (MS) weis husband bought between  and  million of tilray shares according to her disclosure form and the fed the stock continued to surge

it then became clear that neither the fed nor the treasury would take action it would be up to congress with no quick fix in sight in october shares of cannabis companies began to fall

Morgan Stanley (MS) weis husband sold his tilray stake in five sales in early october by then the shares had nearly doubled worth between  and  million according to Morgan Stanley (MS) weis disclosure

the fed imposed new restrictions this year on investing by bank presidents fed board governors and senior staff after the journal reported questionable trading by presidents of two fed banks who subsequently resigned the new rules prohibit trading individual stocks and bonds and require that trades even in mutual funds be preapproved and prescheduled

the new fed rules for top people dont apply to Morgan Stanley (MS) wei because she isnt senior enough the trades were permissible then and are permissible now said the fed spokeswoman

Morgan Stanley (MS) wei referred questions to the fed the spokeswoman said Morgan Stanley (MS) wei had no responsibility or involvement with policy decisions related to bank supervision or the provision of banking services she said the fed did not assert any interest at the time in the federal reserve resolving the conflict between federal and state law in the area of cannabis companies and their access to banking services but rather pointed out that the appropriate resolution of those issues should come from the congress

ethics lawyers said trading such large amounts of an individual stock while the fed is publicly addressing an issue creates an appearance problem even if Morgan Stanley (MS) weis trades didnt violate conflicts rules

roughly seven dozen federal officials reported more than  financial transactions apiece over the sixyear period analyzed by the journal some traded a single stock frequently while others reported hundreds or even thousands of trades across a broad array of stocks bonds and funds

in one instance the commodity futures trading commission permitted short sales contrary to one of the cftcs own rules

the financial disclosure of lihong mcphail an economist at the cftc showed the most trading reported by any federal official in the journals review her husband made more than  trades in an average of about  each trading day according to her disclosure form and the cftc

about onethird of those reported  tradesinvolved shorting stocks or betting on a fall in their price they ranged from amazon to ford motor co to zoom video communications Suncor Energy (Inc.)the cftc said all the short sales were made by her husband

over the years to safeguard the cftcs integrity congress imposed tighter restrictions than at other agencies on employees investing in amending the commodity exchange act congress also declared that any breach by a cftc employee of an investment rule set by the commission could be punishable by up to a  fine and five years in prison the cftcs role doesnt include regulating stocks but in  the agency adopted a rule banning short selling by its employees and their families

nonetheless a cftc ethics official approved short selling by Morgan Stanley (MS) mcphails husband joseph mcphail a cftc spokesman said fearing that the commission could possibly be sued by the employee if we said no the spokesman said the ethics office believed the regulatory provision exceeded the commissions statutory authority

mr mcphail referred questions to the cftc the cftc spokesman said he didnt speak for the mcphails Morgan Stanley (MS) mcphail didnt respond to requests for comment

at the cftc employees are required by statute and by regulations to adhere to strict ethical standards and to disclose personal investments to ensure that the work of the cftc to oversee markets is free from any conflict of interest said the agency spokesman in this instance several years ago the employee sought advice regarding their spouses investments and received approval from career ethics counsel

mr mcphail was a senior policy analyst at the federal deposit insurance corp until september  in a written statement that agency said the fdic expects our employees as public servants to devote their time and efforts to our mission to maintain stability and public confidence in the nations banking system

the defense department was among the federal agencies with the most officials who invested in chinese stocks even as the pentagon in recent years has shifted its focus to countering china

across the federal government more than  officials owned or traded chinese company stocks including officials at the state department and white house the journal found their investments amounted to between  million and  million on average a year

reed werner while serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for south and southeast asia in december  reported a purchase of between  and  of stock in alibaba group holding Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD)

at the time discussions were under way at the pentagon over whether to add the chinese ecommerce giant to a list of companies in which americans were barred from investing because of their alleged ties to the chinese government

defense and state officials pushed to add the company to the blacklist while the treasury feared this would have wide capitalmarkets ramifications mr werner had been involved over a period of months in some discussions about what companies to add to the blacklist former defense officials said

nearly two weeks after the alibaba purchase the treasury updated its list and didnt include alibaba the companys stock rose  that day

three days later mr werners financialdisclosure form shows a sale of between  and  of alibaba stock

the sale came a day before a meeting where defense officials planned to press their case for adding alibaba and two other companies to the blacklist thentreasury secretary steven mnuchin ultimately blocked the effort

in an interview mr werner acknowledged he was involved in discussions about adding alibaba to the list saying he attended a meeting in late  and was on an email chain about the matter he said that he wasnt involved in blacklist discussions during the period the alibaba trades were made and that the trades resulted in a  gain he declined to answer further questions

the pentagon spokeswoman said that the officials who formally compiled and approved the blacklist didnt own stock in affected companies and that supervisors and ethics officials review reports for holdings that could conflict with an employees duties ethics officials certified that mr werner complied with the law

at least  other defense officials in the office of the secretary reported that they or family members owned or traded alibaba between  and  including jack wilmer who served as senior cybersecurity adviser at the white house and then as the pentagons top cybersecurity official

between  and  mr wilmer reported at least Swiss Exchange (SIX) trades which he said totaled around  in the chinese companies alibaba searchengine giant baidu Suncor Energy (Inc.)and china petroleum  chemical corp

mr wilmer said that a money manager handles his trades and that he didnt direct any of those transactions he said he wasnt involved in policymaking decisions that would have affected those stocks and said he didnt see a conflict between his job and investments he left the government in july  before mr trump signed the executive order barring americans from investing in certain chinese companies

within federal agencies ethics officials generally dont consider it their job to investigate whether employees are making stock trades based on information they glean from their government jobs ethics officials ability to spot potential conflicts is limited because they usually dont know what employees are working on

when ethics officials do see a potential violation they can refer it to their agencies inspectors general who refer cases on to the justice department if they find evidence of wrongdoing

a journal review of inspector general reports showed that the offices rarely investigated financial conflicts as more federal officials invest in the stock market ethics officials say they have less time to look into possible wrongdoing when findings have been referred to the justice department prosecutors in most cases have declined to open an investigation

one matter at the securities and exchange commission involved an official who failed to report or clear his and his spouses financial holdings and trades for at least seven years the trades included stocks that sec employees and their families werent allowed to own some of which the sec inspector general determined posed a conflict with the officials work according to a report the inspector general provided to congress

when a us attorney declined to prosecute the secs inspector general reported the findings to sec management the unnamed official ultimately was suspended for seven days and gave up  hours of leave time

the sec declined to comment a justice department spokeswoman declined to comment on individual investigations but said we take all inspector general referrals seriously and bring charges when the facts and law support them consistent with the principles of federal prosecution

are stock trading rules for federal officials ok or should they be further restricted join the conversation below

most federal agencies dont have protocols to verify that officials financial disclosures are complete one agriculture department official disclosed wheat corn and soybean futures and options trades the journal discovered that he had made additional large trades in corn and soybean futures in  and  and omitted them from his reports

the official clare carlson who is no longer at the usda said that he tried to be scrupulous in his disclosures and that the omissions were honest mistakes the agriculture department declined to comment

at the epa mr molinas financialdisclosure reporting caught the attention of ethics officials

the conflictofinterest rules say executivebranch employees may not participate personally and substantially in matters that have a direct and predictable effect on their investments and those of family members

when the ethics officials contacted mr molina about energy stocks he reported on his forms they were told he didnt have any influence over environmental policy

his duties are administrative in nature his boss the epas chief of staff at the time told the ethics officials he provides logistical support to the principal but does not participate personally and substantially in making any decisions recommendations or advice that will have any direct or substantial effect on his financial interests the chief of staff said according to mr molinas financial disclosure

in his time at the epa mr molina clashed with ethics officials many of his financial disclosure reports were inaccurate and tardy according to epa emails reviewed by the journal at one point he didnt file accurate monthly trading disclosures for  months according to the epa emails mr molina reported the stock trades on his annual financial reports as required

ethics officials said they contacted mr molina scores of times to press him to file timely reports according to the emails reviewed by the journal

in one email a senior ethics official said his office had provided you with at least  times more personal assistance than for any other agency employee yet the required ethics reports were still late

mr molina told epa officials that he initially didnt know he was supposed to complete regular stocktrading reports he later struggled to keep up with the epas electronicdisclosure system according to the emails reviewed by the journal

in september  the epa fined mr molina  for numerous failures to disclose stock trades to the agency on time mr molina refused to pay

we have never before had an employee refuse to pay the late fee wrote one ethics officer in an email to mr molina on oct   so i will have to inquire about how to commence garnishment proceedings

the next month mr molina accused ethics officials of discriminating against him i feel that i am being targeted and have been asked to report more than anyone else he wrote in a nov   email

if the intent of these filings is to curb any corruption or misbehavior mr molina wrote the epa should open an investigation i believe that paying such an outrageous fine would be an admission that i have done something wrong in this regard

ethics officials didnt investigate mr molinas trades or refer the matter to internal investigators

on the evening of jan   mr molinas final day working for the government epa ethics officials offered to end the matter if he paid a discounted fine of 

mr molina wrote out a personal check to us treasury and sent it to officials in the epas ethics office including to justina fugh an official with whom he had clashed",1821,buffet says invest in what you know,at this point what even is there to do  rules regulations exceptions waivers traders spouses senior officials inspector generals every agency we have all involved in one way or another we know they know they know we know rules exist to prevent and still goes on blatantly who watches the watchman,thanks for posting this original poster one of the better posts on this sub

Stock market,wallstreetbets,MY (f19) BF (22M) JERKED OFF TO THE STOCK MARKET??,"i know the title sounds deranged but i swear to god im not a troll heres the context

my Brown-Forman Corporation (BF) and i are long distance so we used to have plenty of phone sex however thats been happening less and less often as our relationship has gone on according to him he just doesnt feel as horny as often anymore weve met and had relations in real life a few times and hes always the kind to last very long in bed and during phone sex as well i used to be insecure about it thinking that maybe it was something wrong with me but hes genuinely a great Brown-Forman Corporation (BF) who constantly assures me and has never once said anything bad about our sex life

it should be noted that he watches plenty of porn as do i and neither of us see that as an issue so this isnt about him hiding porn from me or something we were calling today and i was playing a game on my phone papas cupcakeria you cant make this shit up and after about twenty minutes of us doing our own thing he suddenly goes im done and shows me his cum obviously i get really confused and ask how the hell he was jerking off this whole time without me realising we were on video call before mentioning that i thought he was looking at the stock market he spends his free time just staring at the stock market for hours on end like a lunatic but i love him so its whatever

tell me why this man then looks me in the eyes and goes yeah i was looking at the stock market i was too lazy to look for porn

it then hits me that he literally just came to the stock market when i point this out to him all he said in response was its a man thing i didnt wanna bother you while you were playing your game and told me not to worry about it

now i dont want to sound insane but i got a bit upset because in my head he could have very easily asked to have phone sex with me but chose to literally jerk off to the stock market instead to add insult to injury he came really quickly like significantly quicker than he would during anything involving me which makes me feel like shit because there is no way the goddamn stock market is somehow more stimulating than his own damn girlfriend

dont get me wrong im not super genuinely upset but youve gotta admit this shits gonna hurt your pride if it happened to you i honest to god have no idea how to even move forward after this and i just needed to type this out because no one would believe me otherwise",5835,"user report

Trading strategy,wallstreetbets,GME Trading Strategy to Catalyze the Squeeze,"i made a comment yesterday on a post that did some technical analysis on Gamestop Corporation (GME) and several people asked that i turn that comment into a post so here it is

obviously im going to start by saying all of this is based on my opinion of what needs to happen to spark the squeeze

first the comment as it was

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen lots of bullish ta on Gamestop Corporation (GME) keep in mind all ta requires volume to play out how it should we havent had any volume on Gamestop Corporation (GME) in over a week

holding shares simply isnt enough  needs constant all day every single day buying of shares and in the money options

if you buy options that are  in the money they literally cant price pin because they cant get and keep the price  below current market so you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge and virtually eliminate their means of counterattack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain price at which most contracts expire worthless

if you are intending to help push the squeeze buy shares throughout the day every day if you are playing options mostly buy calls in the money if youre buying otm calls buy as close to current price as you can afford the more imbalanced otm calls are the more theyre just going to price pin at maximum pain they literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new itm call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge

essentially we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with gamestop there are two major reasons 

 manipulation we cannot do anything about this really aside from buy and hold technicals actually have a tendencies to work in reverse when a stock is being manipulated at these levels the shorts while stuck in a stupid position arent stupid they know when the ta is indicating a bullish setup and that is the best time for them to attack the stock to break the setup

 volume all technical setups require volume to play out if volume doesnt follow the technical setup fails and the price action is unpredictable except in this case it goes down because its being shorted at every chance

so what do we need to do hold yes but that cant be it if we are doing nothing but holding this will be a stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient they can literally hold us in a stalemate for monthsyears if volume never shows up to move the price yes they pay more interest the longer they have to wait theyll just manipulate other sectors of the market to force gains and cover their losses unless the sec steps in to stop market manipulation 

volume

without volume there is no endgame look at every day weve had spikes look at the volume now look at the past week or two we arent making progress because nobody is buying shares aside from some whale algos that are simply fighting off the short attacks believe it or not the whales do need retail support to force the squeeze the whales are the ones creating momentum from time to time if it catches on they can follow it up but if they just go all out to create a surge and nobody follows behind them to buy they are literally risking billions of dollars to fail

this thing will likely happen in waves over the course of a few days if you look at any day there are surges in buy volume but theyre short thats likely a whale testing the market if they see confirmationfollowup from the market its less risky for them to send a second wave of buying pressure so it will be something like whale buy retail confirmation buys whale buy runaway effect gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze all of those things have to happen consecutively fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack

now this is going to sound counterintuitive but in order to catalyze the squeeze we have to stop just buying the dip when volume picks up and the price is spiking thats the most important time to buy thats the point when additional buying pressure is most important and until the retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes we are going to keep bouncing back and forth

options

the other side of the coin is options purchases stop devoting the majority of your capital to far otm lotto tickets this helps the short positions because it forces the market makers to help the shorts market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk when you buy an c it does two things

 they dont have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral

 in incentivizes the market makers to pin the price

you can do some additional reading on max pain price in options but it is essentially the closing price at which the largest number of options expire worthless when you buy otm call options youre increasing the maximum pain price which makes it easier for market makers and shorts to pin the price there

if however youre buying a ton of itm call options youre doing two things

 deep itm calls have a delta of essentially  this means that in order to remain risk neutral the market makers essentially has to buy  shares immediately upon selling you the contract

 it lowers the max pain price by creating an imbalance towards lower strikes having the most Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI) this means in order to pin the price at max pain they would need to drop it from its current price

not only do you force market makers to be risk neutral immediately meaning they dont care where the price goes you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on the stock price

if you must buy otm calls buy ones that are at least closer to being itm the further otm you buy calls the more likely the price will go sideways you can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as the price increases once it achieves a runaway squeeze which will be easy to identify you can start buying your lotto tickets

too long; didn't read in my opinion if you want to help catalyze the squeeze you need to buy shares when the price is spiking and buy calls that are at least  in the money",2764,buy high never sell got it,makes total sense,i seem to only buy high so this works out for me i try to pick up one extra each day

Trading strategy,wallstreetbets,What's wrong with this trading strategy?,"i gotta be honest with you im kinda mentally handicapped   
but i dont understand how my strategy couldnt work iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been using bollinger bands  
since they do a great job of keeping the chart within the boundaries almost at all times  
so isnt it a good idea to just always sell an asset short while its at the top say above sd  
then secure gains at around the midline wait for it to go to an extreme value again and take a long or short position accordingly once again  
i identified two risks first is the price moving in a slow trend with low volatility when there might not be any opportunity to sell or when the price makes a strong fast movement the first risk can be mitigated by simply selling after some set time and when the price remains roughly in the middle for a long time and the second situation can be identified with moving averages this strategy has a downside of not taking advantage of long and big price movements but should be absolutely killing it in ambiguous market conditions when the price is moving horizontally or at least thats what i figured most stable stocks should have a lot of those boring periods when the strategy works even if the market was changing periodically it should still generate positive outcomes with well planned stop losses how could this not generate worthwhile returns",6,"user report

too long; didn't read i think bollinger bands could be used to generate consistent returns in sideways markets but i may be wrong",ta tells you what has happened   it has zero predictive power   trends that you think are ending will continue beyond what you would expect and price action will reverse at the most unexpected times   bollinger bands are not the path to unlimited effortless money,it is impossible to predict the future movements of markets with  accuracy so there will always be some risk involved in any strategy however your strategy sounds like it could work well in many situations and may produce good returns overall one thing to keep in mind is that bollinger bands are based on historical data so they may not be as accurate in predicting future price movements also moving averages can lag behind the current price so you might miss out on some potential profits if the market starts moving up or down quickly overall though this seems like a solid strategy that could work well in many cases

Options trading,wallstreetbets,I am never trading options again,"this was the original title and post i wrote up before the events of thursday transpired everything in quotes was written by past me 

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) disabled options trading i will dump all my money into blue chips and index funds iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) just made k over a span of  days 





the screen shots are incomplete because i was trying to sell quick its about k profit when you factor in i lost k entering the trade on shorter dated puts 

im going to be completely candid whether that gets me banned or not i will take that risk 

from the moment i uttered this comment i set fourth the most regarded scheme in history 



at the time frc hadnt halted trading i reached out to robinhood support to get their stance on what would happen during a halt i didnt show the full conversation but they were extremely unclear they said that i would be short if i exercised but id have a hard time covering that short position although this is not saying yes or no its definitely terrible communication on their part 

a lawsuit based on the hypothetical scenario we discussed is a complete long shot out of curiosity i asked a lawyer that day they said i was likely to win if robinhood backed out but they needed more details i did not trust this scummy lawyer i had another option  they have a history of bending to social media backlash theres even this disclaimer when stocks are halted 



i thought i could increase the odds by creating viral posts about robinhoods misdeeds hopefully robinhood would crack knowing their name was being smeared on the front page of reddit wsb backing me would have been helpful but not necessary i just needed to make noise 

i believed the chances i could cash out were high to begin with i was sortve right multiple brokers allowed exercising into a short just not robinhood they still may have made an exception as their support told me multiple times it might happen but i wasnt about to wait till expiration without a fight 

within the quest to fight robinhood i made this bet 



robinhood did not allow short selling for frc put holders as the terms of the bet demanded i sold the contracts instead of exercising based on the terms of the bet i do not have to pay anything i still planned on donating a few thousand until yesterday

whether this scheme would have worked i guess well never know frc began trading otc and exercising was not necessary anymore 

despite being correct iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) taken up a reckless unsustainable trading approach if i continue on this path i will lose everything iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen it so many times where someone makes a very intelligent correct trade then starts thinking theyre a trading genius they start making reckless bets in things they have no business buying this is an extremely slippery slope for me iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) blown up multiple accounts and i refuse to make the same mistake i hope i can set an example dont keep rolling the dice take the money and run 

i know its very obvious to everyone cashing out is the smart thing to do but in my position the rush of euphoria from a massive win like this is intoxicating the sobering despair of previous losses melts away its very hard to fight the imaginative ideas of becoming a multimillionaire and retiring under  i hope i can set an example and inspire others to break the gambling cycle hopefully i will be able to maintain self control but the urge to make one more bet is always there i refuse let myself squander this life altering amount of money

present moment

i saw pacw tanking after hours based on news that they were looking for sellers they had already said this in their er that they were looking to sell assets i felt the drop overblown fear from frcs collapse 

i bought when it was at  but because i didnt put a limit order in rh averaged purchase price was fucking  my god immediate k loss



 then i think to myself pacws drop is not completely overblown the need to shore up liquidity is bad in this environment and a recovery is higher risk so i thought let me buy a regional that is being pulled down just because everything is tanking First Tennessee National Corporation (FHN) 

the Toronto Dominion Bank (The) (TD) CNOOC Limited (CEO) firmly stated they were committed to buying First Tennessee National Corporation (FHN) so any massive drop has huge upside surely Toronto Dominion Bank (The) (TD) wouldnt back out of the deal  hours after i go all in 



i am completely spiraling into whirlpool of gambling and degeneracy i am trying to control myself i lost another k yesterday and made it back just as quick im playing with fire and im foolishly dead set on making back what iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) lost iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) finally found an amazing risk reward trade to make all my money back plus profit selling wal puts i still stand by the idea that this current panic in regionals is far overblown wal especially is nothing like frc and its odds of collapse are extraordinarily low currently selling  puts for a huge premium while that stock is at  this is a very safe bet to make back everything i will roll into the  puts for an even safe bet iv is at  this is almost free money wal is not like frc even if pacw falls wal will be ok 



then i can finally end this nightmare quit the gambling and move on with my life no more sleepless nights no more insane schemes i will finally come out on top and follow my original intentions after i made out on frc i am jumping into a wild ape cage posting this i am revealing myself to be a reckless fool to the millions that believe i owe an autism charity k the internet is brutal do with me what you will",2478,"im never trading options again

so i found this strat where im selling puts on wal for a huge premium",robinhood gave you the money cause they knew they would get it back,you are going to lose everything might as well give it to charity today

Fundamental analysis,wallstreetbets,AMC - Quick technical and fundamental analysis for the next weeks,"whats up apes

lets have a quick look at amc and some possible scenarios for next week

too long; didn't read at the bottom

the sell off has considerably slowed down in the last month and the price has been mostly consolidating between  and  usd better than expected results for the third quarter and some news announced in the earnings call on the th of august have led to a considerable price increase and gap up  which was quickly met with strong selling back down to support from there price has once again formed a double bottom and was mostly up in the following  or  trading days

overall volatility and volume are down which is good news for the bulls because it indicates that the bears have lost some steam

lets have a look at the technicals  


price action

price is currently trading inside two wedge patterns a small and a big one indicated in the chart below with red and blue trend lines if price breaks the upper red line a rally and a test of the upper resistance of the big wedge usd is likely if it bounces off that resistance i expect price to retest the lower red support again usd a break and daily close above  would indicate forther upside target  usd while a break and daily close below would indicate further downside target  usd



macd

the daily macd has turned green for the first time since june the moving averages are crossing overall the macd suggest the momentum is shifting to the upside



rsi

there is a bullish divergence in the rsi matching rsi lows while second price low was lower than the first as well as a double bottom overall the rsi indicates a decreasing bearish momentum and suggests that a at least temporary bottom might be in



too long; didn't read  points of interest

long positions i am looking for an entry around  usd if price falls down there again i am also looking for a break of the upper red resistance for a rally to  if  breaks i am looking at 

short positions i am looking at a bounce either off the upper red resistance back to  or if that resistance breaks a bounce off the upper blue resistance back to either the upper red trendline or if that breaks  usd however bears should be careful price is down quite a lot never chase

Fundamental analysis,wallstreetbets,TSLA fundamentals analysis - why it's not overvalued,"arks latest price target for tesla has been the subject of a lot of discussion lately they believe it will reach  per share in the next  years which based on its current market price of  implies about a  annual rate of return if you havent already you can take a look at the  they published explaining how they arrived at this price target and the assumptions they made

i recently got  for suggesting that this price target wasnt illogical and that cathie wasnt crazy so i wanted to explain my reasoning a bit more so that more people can downvote me and tell me why im wrong

now just to be clear im not here to argue about whether evs are the future whether existing car companies are unprepared to switch to Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) or whether tesla is an insurance play im assuming that youre already interested in investing in tesla and the only thing stopping you is its valuation

pe its over  but is it a useful metric

pe seems to be the most common argument for why tesla is overvalued why buy tesla at  pe when you could buy General Motors Corporation (GM) at  pe or even workhorse at  pe

lets step back a bit companies can be categorized into one of three stages growth maturity and decline pe is useful for valuing mature companies against their mature competitors since all other things being equal wed expect their pes to eventually equalize as well for example i recently bought target partly because of its pe of  vs walmarts  and costcos  although one could argue that someall of these companies are still in their growth stage

on the other hand pe is less useful when looking at companies in the growth and decline phases you could find companies with pe below  but they may be value traps rather than automatic buys if they go out of business next year their stock will be worthless

pe is similarly flawed when looking at growth stocks pe doesnt account for whether a company is spending a lot aggressively reinvesting in itself or if a company has small earnings now but a good chance of quickly growing into a much larger market if you had the chance to buy a lossmaking company now at b market cap now knowing that its addressable market will quickly expand to b youd still make a profit over the long term even buying at massively inflated pe

that said pe is still useful for measuring risk in a growth stock or upside in a declining stock if tesla were to transition from growth to maturity or decline theres no doubt its pe and share price would decline significantly but risk is part of growth investing this risk exists with other growth stocks too

forward pe

while teslas trailing pe is  its forward pe is a high but less eyepopping  trailing pe is calculated by dividing the stocks market value by its share price while forward pe is calculated by dividing the companys estimated earnings in the following year by its share price forward pe is a more errorprone and risky metric since nobody knows what a company will earn in the future but it can still be useful when considering the price of a stock since the market tends to price in expected future performance

comparing to some other popular growth stocks teslas forward pe is still high but not unreasonable pins has  shop has  Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) has  and at least its positive many growth stocks such as Nuveen Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NIO) nkla lucid pltr and lmnd dont expect to be profitable within the next year

and while teslas pe is high its difficult to make a direct comparison with these mentioned companies since theyre not profitable companies in the Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) space there really isnt another profitable Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) company to compare forward pe with and that uniquenessfirst mover advantage could be partly why tesla trades at a high forward pe

that said tesla is still overpriced if unfairly comparing against mature automakers General Motors Corporation (GM) is at  forward pe f is at  but if you believe those companies have a chance to become Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) growth companies and wont be weighed down by their maturedeclining combustion businesses id argue thats more of a reason to buy them than to sell tesla

pricetosales

if a company is reinvesting in itself aggressively it may be incurring costs that arent part of its core business once growth slows it may be able to cut these expenses and dramatically improve its pe to account for this we can look at price to sales

tslas pricetosales is  for comparison shop is at  pltr is at  fvrr is at  Nuveen Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NIO) is at  nkla is chilling at  lucid is at infinity since it doesnt have sales yet its quite an oversimplification to make these comparisons without considering what portion of a companys expenses is related to operating costs shop has better margins than tsla for example since its in a totally different business but nevertheless one could argue tsla is currently undervalued by this metric even compared to other Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) companies

a historical example

another common argument is that the whole market is overvalued right now and this is especially the case for growth stocks i dont pretend to know what the market will do in the short term and im certainly not discounting the possibility of a further rotation out of growth in the near future but i know that eventually the market will rotate back into growth stocks you may have looked like a fool buying amazon or microsoft at the height of the dot com bubble but if you held until now youd get the last laugh

so lets look at an example from a time when there was less talk about stocks being overvalued facebook ipod in  at a pe of  and price to sales of   both fb at the time and tsla now have an annual growth rate of about 

if we take teslas forward pe this comparison actually makes teslas price look reasonable even though tesla currently trades in a market with record high average pe

market cap

one last note  market cap yes teslas market cap is quite high as its already one of the most valuable companies in the world at b if tesla actually reached  per share it would be the most valuable company in the world unless other top companies continue to grow as well which is likely
the global market for evs is expected to grow to b by  from b in  if this is accurate and you believe tesla retains its market share and current valuation without expanding into other areas like ride hailing and insurance then  the Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) market xing could justify teslas share price xing

too long; didn't read

while tesla is certainly overvalued by trailing pe this is a somewhat flawed metric and by looking at other metrics like forward pe pricetosales and growth rate an argument can be made that tesla is moreorless fairly valued and potentially even undervalued this argument holds even if looking at historical examples from less frothy markets such as fb after its ipo in 

like any growth stock tesla is a highrisk investment since its future share price depends on future growth of both the company and the Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) space but the potential for reward is also higher

Fundamental analysis,wallstreetbets,PLTR - Technical/Fundamental Analysis from a Professional Investor - Update 12/29,"so a lot has happened with the shares

the wedge looks like it has broken down but it could easily be just an extension of a wedge the point is that we dont have a full breakdown unless we spend considerable time below  then i could maybe see things fall back down to  i think it is far more likely we just remain in this extended consolidation phase of  until we get some sort of a catalyst or a short squeeze



but this is not the point of the post today today i am here to convince you why a cost basis of  or  doesnt matter for pltr you are buying the company at around x e sales which seems quite high  not as much compared to snow and some other big data plays but still so why bother with pltr

before i proceed i know most people who are here cant read and i am going to be dropping a gigantic wall of text which i expect all maybe two of your guys to read so here is the short form      

this was the primer i had written on information technology  back in 



i started by looking at the sp since the early s to understand if there was a mental model i could use to outperform the index what i found was that starting in the late s most of the companies that ended up creating enormous shareholder value started as technology companies dupont was a technology company in the s edison electric was a technology company in the s General Motors Corporation (GM) was a technology company in the s if one looks at the market capitalization of companies today many of the largest are todays technology companies google apple amazon microsoft have market capitalizations which eclipse many old traditional industries

there is clearly something about technology companies that allows them to generate enormous shareholder value and create wealth for society after all if the stock index was still dominated by the likes of american cotton oil and american sugar refining like in the s we would all be living in a different and much poorer world the challenge with investing in technology companies is that for every edison electric there is a zenith radio for every International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) there is a sinclaire rearch and for every apple there is a blackberry there had to be a way to analyze or put into context why some companies last longer than others and why some managed to generate returns over a thousand fold for its investors while others fizzile and pop with the latest turn in the economic cycle

i agree with peter thiels thesis that technology advancement is probably slowing down and primarily concentrated around information technology as a result of regulations around the world of stuff i believe this will continue to be the trend of the next  years with some exceptions and that the rise of ai may start creating innovation again in many static fields i believe historically there were massive innovation happening across multiple disciplines from the ss where technological progress branched  out like a tree and built on itself since the s or so this branch narrowed  into only a few sectors primarily focused in information technology

so i wanted to strip out the massive amount innovations that have taken place around agriculture communications transportation energy and petrochemicals over the past  years it is helpful to think backwards if you will focusing on just the age of computers and back into the late s into the birth of the electronic age when we focus on just the computer led revolution in the s and electricity revolution in the s we start seeing some interesting trends

information technology cycles

the following is my attempt at describing from a very high level the history of computing and informational technology what i found was that technology moves both in cycles of proliferation and consolidation and that there is a directional theme

electronic age

electricityscaled power  platform competition and consolidation phase edison vs tesla enterprise facing originally to convince government and factory owners to replace physical laborimportant companies ge and westinghouse

electronics  electricity prices fall as infrastructure rollout creating a proliferation of electronic hobbyists and startups hardware dominates first half platform dominates next half consumer facingimportant companies rca zenith galvin motorola most went belly up upstream and downstream do well

electronics consolidation  the electronics sector consolidates with content platform operators software dominating and winners usually emerge from previously niche targetsimportant companies att nbc International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)

computingsoftware age

computingscaled electronic  platform consolidation International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and the seven dwarfs enterprise facing originally to convince government and large scale enterprise to replace  basic mental laborimportant companies International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)

from hardware to software  computing price falls creating a proliferation of hobbyists it startups and companies lots of pc makers who go bust software and internet dominate in the second halfimportant companies intel microsoft apple dell most early pc makers go belly up up and downstream do well

software consolidation  sectors like retail information and social consolidate hardware continues to fall away to software as content platform start to dominate winner is emerging across multiple sub verticalsimportant companies amazon apple alibaba tencent

cloudai age

machine learning mlsmart software  platform consolidation phase enterprise facing convince companies this is the future of advanced mental labor it will be about the use of ai at the industrial scale being adapted by corporations and governments for various analytical resource management and decision making processescandidate important companies aws microsoft palantir companies yet to exist in china

specialized ai  machine learningai becomes cheaper creating a proliferation of ai hobbyists and developers high level programing focused consumer facing this will be about the proliferation of ai in our everyday lives just as how starting in the s the story of technology was one with the integration of computers and software to our daily lives to some extent outsourcing the memorylogic processing components of our lives to computers now we will be calling upon multiple ais to do many deal of the functions of our lives in perhaps faster input times using neural interfaces companies and products could be formed in seconds from simply thinking through the process and outsourcing it to smart software who functionally construct its various parts in second to minutes depending on how quickly you can direct and scale your digital minions to do your biddingcandidate important companies most will go bust up and downstream will likely do well

general ai  consolidation of softwareai it will be about the web linkages of humanai integration whether this looks like some sort of neural net where we live in a web of information buffeted by our web of ai advisors

the average core technology cycle seems to be approximately  years with  years of infrastructure platform competition and rollout  years of new venture creation most of which gets washed out and  years of industry consolidation

the initial phase of the cycle is dominated by  players fighting it out in a standards war that then gets rolled out as the foundational infrastructure of the next  years

in the initial phase the general theme is that the companies start off as enterprise and government facing in the historical electronics and computer cycle there has been two such periods the roll out of electrical grid by gewestinghouse and the roll out of mainframe computers by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) in the case of the Alliance Capital Management Holding L.P. (AC) vs dc standard war between edison and tesla both men through their respective backers ge and westinghouse to invent and supply standardized power equipment and build power plant the initial consumers were local government to replace previous gas lamp systems with electrical street lamps and to factories the new technology was seen as cheaper and more efficient than previously gas operated lambs operated by cities and more importantly electricity delivered by wire is seen as much more efficient than having onsite power for factory operators allowing for the displacement of onsite steam engines and boilers the birth of the mainframe computer was similar although less competitive due to an earlier lead and first mover position International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was able to dominate the market over its competitors making them irrelevant the mainframe computer was sold to large corporations and government defense agencies for the calculation of complex formulas that had previously required the employment of hundreds of staff the two initial cycles produce two monopolistic businesses that are still dow components today ge and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) which set the standard for a drop in the price of electricity and computing that would benefit the next phase of the cycle

the proliferation phase the general theme is that there is a cheapening of the previous platform technology electricity and computing power which enables hobbyists to take advantage and start building new products in the electronics and pc space this is characterized by period of high new firm creation high levels of creativity and a move from enterprise focus to the consumer we saw it in the s with the birth of the electronics industry there were dozens of radio makers appliance makers and various electronics manufacturing startups during this time there was heavy competition from the host of new hardware businesses with most profits coming from International Paper Company (IP) licensing a similar analogy could be made of the pc era of the ss there was a lot of hardware makers it was highly competitive and the winners of the era were primarily focusing on software ie microsoft

the consolidation phase in the case of the s the commoditization of hardware created an opportunity for content providers history is littered with names of large scale manufacturer that are now defuct names like zenith admiral and dozens of electronics makers which use to hover midwestern industrial hubs such as chicago the content providers in radio and Grupo Televisa S.A. (TV) became more dominant through the current consolidation phase starting in  we see less new venture creation and generally a focus on the contentdistribution platform side of consumer technology amazon netflix google apple are key examples of the shift

what it means today

i would argue that we are in the consolidation part of the cycle until  where it will continue to be about shrinking number of consumer technology players and the dominance of content over infrastructure this explains the phenomenal increase of fang stocks relative to the rest of the market as a result for the next  years if one can pick good entry points for amazon i will discuss my dislike of google in a future post one will be successful and the company will likely last for a long time it remains to be seen if apple can create a bigger ecosystem contrarian value plays probably revolve around chinese adrs which are out of favor with the us public

from  onward the most exciting prospect is the idea of a repeat of the infrastructure buildout that happened at the onset of the electricity and computing age i believe that the new phase will be targeting enterprise and government and will be a winner take all fight similar to the few cycles the previous cycles revolved around scaled mechanical energy and scaled linear mental processing i believe the next phase will revolve around advanced mental processing i think that corporations and government while benefiting from scale are beholden to inefficient decision making due to complicated management structuring the automation of complex management process that can analyze of complex large data and deploy resources more efficiently will become invaluable to large corporategovernment clients companies that have potential in this space are big data players with big client channels like aws and palantir or emergent players which have yet to develop in the us or china it is also possible that will come from a spinout team from one of current tech giants

it is a serious mistake to continue to look for consumer plays in the technology space i believe that the sector is consolidating and played out new entrants will find it nearly impossible to survive at the downturn of the next cycle and current incumbents will solidity their positioning the next batch of potentially interesting companies will likely come from the enterprise space while wall street analysts continues to be focused on aws and the fight over iaas and Pan American Silver Corp. (PAAS) the most interesting segment to watch is in advanced analytics and resource allocation tools which is ripe for innovation there are lots of fat in the middle management layer of corporations and governments i strongly believe that this space is where the next once in a generation infrastructure player like ge and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) can offer an impressive solution which will fill the niche the early identification of this companycompanies will generate significant out performance relative to any market benchmark

 update

if we are in the infrastructure rollout stage than first mover absolutely has an advantage as we could see with ge International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and microsoft to some extent during the previous eras in the consolidation ages the last mover had an advantage amazon and apple were not the first ecommerce or hardware makers but are likely the last because they benefit from  a slow down of technology and a focus on ease of use and scale  this is why every contract and sticky ones pltr has is so important because these relationships will scale in a nonlinear way once ai and machine learning starts making its way into  large institutions and first mover advantage is very very important here just like how ge was working around the clock to sign on factories and local governments for lighting and electricity contracts once they were in that is forever and they could start selling other equipment and devices all of which were collecting licensing or patent fees

i have very high conviction on palantir  i believe the reason above is what drove peter thiel to invest into palantir because it is building the infrastructure layer for the age of ai and pltr is primed to becoming the single most important company in technology for the next  decades and will be a x bagger

thanks autist obligatory",my time horizon is  months though
Fundamental analysis,wallstreetbets,Customer-Centric Fundamental Analysis of $AMC,"Gamestop Corporation (GME) featured later in the post too 

sorry if this E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) sucks ass and leads a bunch of people to ditch amc just focus on the future and think about the mind of the consumer most of that shit they teach in business school is bullshit is trash trust me 


i will return to that a bit later in this E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) heres another take based on fundamentals on why you might consider amc at share one of the great value investment opportunities of our time bear with me as i too am just a retard like some of the readers here

lets begin with the basic asymmetries in a macroeconomic context

 market cap Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (MC)   m
 enterprise value Eaton Vance Corporation (EV)  b


when seeing that figure you might wonder if you dont know shit why might a company have an enterprise value so much greater than its market cap a companys Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) is the total debt  market cap  cash on hand as you may have heard in the recent news nobody is having trouble getting access to cash so then why might that figure be significant at all if it is practically just about how much the company owes  aggregate value of the stonk well my father used to say the price of a product is what someone is willing to pay for it if someone wanted to buy or takeover amc they need to pay around  b in a few months i anticipate that number to be so much higher


the main reason i think amc dropped so low and generated so much short seller risk to begin with is the fact that there was a bankruptcy risk that risk has been wholly eliminated though i never saw it


as we find ourselves in a cash flush world where at least  trillion in debt is negative yielding  we should expect a company with so many assets and a previously healthy balance sheet like amc to be have access to some of it the rising stonk price even incentivized silverlake to convert their debt to shares and sell them silly bankers


at the same time the allstar CNOOC Limited (CEO) boomer adam aron himself grabbed an additional  m in cash through a direct listing initiated on monday i dont know why he couldnt wait until wednesday to initiate because  i trust his judgement boomers are more experienced and have steady hands at the same time aron beat back the well known short selling smuts known as apollo global management as they attempted to force bankruptcy on amc


the confluence of these factors Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) access to liquidity stellar executive team and the four i outline below lead me to believe that even stevie wonder can see that this stock is obviously worth at least share  



the undisputed market leader in theaters


  theatres worldwide
    many auditoriums at amc locations often holding over more than one auditorium seat over  people 
       they posted  million in revenues auditoriums were rarely at capacity
     screensauditoriums
    they will all be packed when opened back up
       tons of really great movies were held anticipating the end of the lockdown and the reopening of the movies keep this in mind this is critical to the fundamental analysis and related to the subsequent points
    margins are ok but especially good on the snacks in the past consumers have tended to say fuck amcs margins and bring in their own goodies either because amcs were ass or because they wanted to save a few dollars we expect this pattern to slow down substantially because of what they mean for the people  i recognize that this one is a reach but its my opinion not investment advice


the shifting sentiment from netflix and chill to inperson shared and enjoyable experience


 i dont like people but i miss them maybe you do too in a midpandemic gallup poll we all know how much those matter  if i just put my finger in the air and give  of netflixs market cap to amc you see where im going with this
 i have seen others say this one as well but i miss when everyone went to the movies and watch the same thing on the same screen at the same time because we can share 
 netflix and the streamers need to watch out because come july the boomer is coming with that heat everyone is anticipating trips to movies i tried to make the popcorn i used a half a stick of butter its not the same
    running to eleven to get slurpees and raisinets while netflix is buffering is super annoying last time my eleven didnt even have raisinets samuel l jackson voice wheres my mothafuckin raisinets jack
 as you think through this point remember the last time you saw samuel l jackson in the theaters you werent the only that was scared so it was entertaining and not stressful
 this point isnt totally out of my ass either as streaming popularity has grown so has amcs  revenues not including  people watch more movies


relationship with distributors and studios is still a strong moat   

everyone here should check out a movie they dont have the awesome search and browse capabilities afforded by netflix or the sweeping device compatibility you can stream from your laptop and connect to your  


 studios have ben delaying their films repeatedly to wait for amc to open back up to me that sounds like immense power and a very strong relationship i commend the studios for that and i think you have to be a hedge fund jackass not value that moat accordingly even morningstar sees that and they usually dont see shit
 the netflix app is cool but we can all agree ampampampampampampampampgt  of the content is ass movies are a crap shoot shows are a political statement and theres not enough chapelle
    what chapelle represents amongst so many other things is someone who has walked away from the traditional film industry while i am all for the new person on the block i feel movies are very hard to make sometimes the netflix ones suck hard i dont recall too many times when i went to a movie theater and had to leave because the movie sucked that bad iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been disappointed underwhelmed but have never chucked my remote at the screen i cannot say the same about netflix i have seen some terrible shit on netflix multiple times i go there every day still because their app is so good but hollywood is still better at making films than los gatos or wherever the fuck 
 you can rent some of the movies that would be in theaters now im sure the quality of the acting and dialogue will be superior to the shit we often get on netflix
    i havent done it yet but i promise to do it for the first time tonight as i discovered the  product line in doing some research for this E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) i assure you that the products will be overpriced and the digital experience will be ass but they just got  m to go figure that shit out 
    boomer CNOOC Limited (CEO) lower your price point and move your onprem servers to Engelhard Corporation (EC) instances you got this reinvest hard for a while as you build up the integrations to be a firstclass citizen in roku etc 


fresh squeezed orange juice

in doing more research i learned that both amc and amcx were seeing incredible short interest every resource i used reported both higher than they should be but the inconsistency in the numbers from trusted and premium services has led me to withhold my numbers  the ranges for amc were between  of total float and  of total float when i tried to calculate myself based on short interest theory and the average volume of the stock as of  a month ago i landed at  since i am retarded the answer is probably in the  


current short volume  shares


true float   shares


dollar volume sold short  million 


on the last one yes you read that right this idiots have sold more short volume in price than the market cap of the stock how could they do this shit all over again they dont give a fuck they think they will get away with it 



regardless some idiots sold another  shares short on friday well i have  shares across four platforms i am buying more on monday but my buddy had an interesting idea because the stock is so low options may actually be an even better play for me because i can buy hundreds of them thanks to this subreddit if i exercise as many options as i can hold the stock with diamond hands it could accelerate the gamma squeeze that will happen if those short selling assholes dont back down  and we know they wont  


in closing as with Gamestop Corporation (GME) i have fond memories of my times at amc as a child and teenager it was the first place my friend drove me after he got his license 

also as with Gamestop Corporation (GME) i like the stock


positions


shares  avg cost basis of   i have been building up for a while


options a lot strike prices ranging from  to  because these jackasses thought they knew what the fuck was going on but are out of touch with the commoner on monday i will buy more  of my options are already in cheese


on webull i learned that you can buy stonks starting at  am   am or something like that so i am moving some money in there


edit i will set a limit order of  to expire in  days the brokerage cannot sell my shares if i still dont want to sell at that price and it gets close just add another  i will never sell but always have a limit order if these short sellers want to try and screw you out of deep fucking value 


 i know netflix has a los angeles office you jackass a lot of their content still sucks its just a fucking fact",208,stonks only go up,amc and Gamestop Corporation (GME) hold like you hold your self watching your wife and her boyfriend,i like the a m c
Fundamental analysis,wallstreetbets,I track YOLOs so you don't have to - August 2019 (+ new fundamental analysis added to the site),"for those of you that arent familiar with the site i created its at



it contains a wsb sentiment analyzer due diligence tracker and a you only live once tracker

 quick how it works

i log positions of posts flagged as yologainslosses and post them to my site for actual options you only live once plays it will automatically keep track the current value of the play and the winloss percent every position on the site links back to its appropriate thread on wallstreetbets so you can take a look and read the commentsjuicy details as well all other gains losses and expired yolos are placed in the expired yolos section

new section iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) added a new section of top yolos here you can go through the top yolos of all time tyoat and view the yolos by most upvotes biggest gains biggest losses

please note i do my best to keep track of them all and sometimes the original poster of the you only live once disappears in which case i let the you only live once ride until expiry its fun to see what they could be worth

recent additions to the site

 as per last months post iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) finally pushed the updates that include viewing some nice stock financial charts and fundamental analysis heres a short breakdown of the new features iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) added if you want a full summary on them i made a post in rstockmarket that has a lot more info the post can be found here



xb

new features

 a new stocks section where you can search stocks outside of the wallstreetbets sentiment in this section you can search for tickers to do your own fundamental analysis the stock page contains the following data

a shortterm stock chart fundamental data key stats and recent news

b stock financials for you fake autists you can finally view your favorite stock financials data in nicely organized charts w pretty colors here you can quickly scan fundamental financial data to get a quick understanding of how your stock is operating personally i find the charts on the fundamental data section the most helpful but if you want to dive into all the financial statements thats cool too for you real autists who love crunching numbers switch between chartmode and textify to read those beautiful numbers

c historical earnings wanting to do an earnings you only live once view how your stock has reacted in the past to previous earnings report and take a gamble where the next one will go a good example of this is Apple Computer, Inc. (AAPL) whos stock price has declined on earnings only  time literal wow

 earnings calendar my earnings calendar isnt as pretty as earnings whisperers calendar but i feel it provides a bit more data to see who is reporting that day scroll below the calendar and youll be able to see all recent earnings reports and stock price reactions to those reports the calendar only displays stocks greater than b in market cap but there is a button at the top to display all upcoming earnings in listview

xb

future updates heres what i am currently working on for the site and should be ready in the next week or two

i am currently working on adding an options analyzer tool the tool will work by scanning dayold options data maybe  days old for smaller cap stocks less than b and log it to my database it will be similar to barcharts option analyzer tool mine is also free but i wanted to focus on less of an options screenerfilter and more on improving how you can compare the prices on purchasingselling an option for example the tool can be used mainly in the following ways

xb

 view the historical yield for an option of a specific expiration date throughout the entire life of the option ie you view the call option chains for Apple Computer, Inc. (AAPL) on september   you will be able to view an estimation of what the options were yielding say at  otm from inception to current date and see how the option price changed with reporting earnings or other market fluctuationsnews

 filter through a list options of highest premiums and lowest premiums use this tool to see where you might want to sell a covered call or a spread and collect premium vs outright buying the option instead this tool will be great as a guideline rather than an indicator ie you see jnug is at the top of the list providing  premium on week options doesnt necessarily mean its the best option to collect premium on however if youve been following Apple Computer, Inc. (AAPL) and you see its reached a high of  you can then see how much premium you might be able to collect by selling a call spread or covered call

 option yields comparisons say youve been following  stocks dis Apple Computer, Inc. (AAPL) Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) you think all  stocks have been hit very hard in the short term due to some trump tweets so you think it could be a great time to collect some premium by selling puts on the stock the yieldscomparison tool will be able to show you what each of the  stocks are currently offering in terms of yields and help you with your decision

the options tool will also tell you specifically which options include an upcoming earnings which would become more of a gamble at that point so you can avoid accidentally purchasing options that are more expensive due to earnings

Fundamental analysis,wallstreetbets,GME: My easy to understand and short fundamentals analysis March 24,"not a financial advice

i did company valuations before and have gotten pretty accurate estimates while im doing this valuation on Gamestop Corporation (GME) i can tell that i like the fundamentals of gamestop just think about it
 stating the obvious but would any of these senior leadership with massive backgrounds go work in a sinking ship of course not gamestop for the long run
 the gaming industry is growing on a compound annual growth rate of  and no one is positioned to take over that market like gamestop now with all their existing members and experience in the industry
 ecommerce sales of gamestop accounts for  of all sales in just a year this is insanely good reducing the brick and mortar side of business and increasing the online one is how its gonna be going forward and this is all done under the supervision of ecommerce geniuses who built startups from scratch
 when gamestop closes many of their stores that cost a lot of money per year theyll cut down on staffing rents and utilities which in turn will reduce their overall costs and increase their margins they can even reduce margin on consoles and other accessories to the extent where its perfect competition with amazon and ignite that huge used products market 

its late here and i have to sleep but theres a lot more that makes me believe this company is worth much more than chewy zalando and other ecommerce platforms

not a financial advice but heres how im thinking about it",1032,jenna owens didnt leave amazon to not get m in bonus money in a sinking ship not taking questions was probably a big f u to the analysts that pissed them off last time,"but they missed earnings  by  cent id say they did pretty damn good over all 

and i agree all that talent on a sinking ship",they should reduce their overall store locations but opt to put together  warehouse like locations for supply chain purposes maybe make it a warehouse that not only gets its products out immediately they seem to strive for sameday shipping but also allows people to come in and get what they need if they were to want to do that cost of having your own locations instead of paying to use others would have to be better one would think

 swot analysis

strengths

 most valuable automotive company it is currently the the automotive company with the highest market capitalisation
 tesla increased its electric vehicle delivery in  it increased its deliveries of  from  thousands  to  million units
 crosssell and diversification tesla has comprehensive insurance program for its vehicles in association with liberty mutual insurance company
 innovative company tesla has a very high rate of innovation the market expects the company to develop competitive and profitable products

 weaknesses

 manufacturing complications tesla faces continuous launch manufacturing and production ramp delays while launching their new vehicles and other products for example tesla faced endless manufacturing challenges when they were about to launch model x which lead to constant delays for distribution similarly the company went through extreme troubles while manufacturing model xs battery module assembly line at gigafactory 
 unable to meet demand might affect brand value due to highly experimenting and complicated procedures tesla might face an unbalanced supply and demand unable to meet the production ramp
 lack of high volume production it has failed to produce high volumes of automobiles for any of its models even now as the company plans to manufacture model  vehicles at high volume it faces issues in terms of production cost and management resources
 shortage of batteries the shortage directly affectes the sales of electric vehicles and energy storage systems
 elon musk as teslas sole representative musk is deeply involved in other projects and side quests
 financial uncertainty tesla has outstanding debt of  billion if the company is unable to generate enough cash flow to repay its debt then there is a risk of delaying expansion reducing investments selling assets etc
 employee safety concerns tesla was recently fined in  for creating a tent production line without a permit or safety inspection also the company did not train workers about the risks of working in the tent for long periods under the scorching californias heat
 leadership wrangles friction and conflict between management and the board of directors can undermine productivity and longterm success teslas management and board have been engaged in several power struggles
 tesla faces lawsuit over sexual misconduct many tesla workers filed a lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct and harassment at the workplace the women have complained that the company fosters a dark culture of sexual misconduct they also alleged that they were catcalled and were frequently subjected to shameful remarks groping and misogynistic behaviour

 opportunities

 bringing battery production technology inhouse tesla intends to make its own battery cells
 market confidence in tesla the stock market has shown confidence in tesla after beating the projected car deliveries

 product defects teslas cars and other energy products have exhibited major flaws in many cases the defective products often have weaknesses in design manufacturing and other features which harm the companys image permanently
 long term confidence tesla due to its unstable manufacturing conditions suffers from disbelief among the public about its longterm existence which can result in a deficiency in further business development
 customer adaptation the company highly depends upon customers willingness to adopt electric vehicles
 disruption of supply due to shortage of materials tesla can face major suspensions in the supply of manufacturing materials due to the increased prices the company uses aluminum steel lithium nickel copper and cobalt as well as lithiumion cells from suppliers all these materials have volatile prices which can affect the companys production line severely in the future
 highrisk factor due to usage of lithiumion tesla uses lithiumion cells in their battery packs lithium is a highly reactive and explosive element which increases the risk factor of our products tesla has faced a a few cases where their cars have caught fire and vented smoke which has defamed the company on a major level
 elon musks behavior affecting teslas reputation teslas entire reputation is built upon the cult of elon musk but recently his waky behavior and impulsive reactions are affecting tesla

Fundamental analysis,wallstreetbets,Why are BioNTech & Moderna up 5% every day on no news? (Fundamental analysis),"biontech was  on july  and is  today  trading days later its rsi is approaching  moderna went from  to 

i understand they delivered wonders for humanity with effective covid vaccines but the magnitude of the surge is highly unusual 

 delta  the variant is not exactly news at this point the world has already gone through  major waves this wave isnt expected to be as bad as last winters when bion stock actually fell from  to  between early dec   early jan 

 earnings  since pfizer reported earnings last week bion has run up another  since then they split vaccine revenues  a large earnings beat should be more than priced in already

 total addressable market

a government deals  bion  moderna raised their vaccine prices in the latest eu contract but this has been known for some time the us government might push back against similar price increases

b booster shots  cdc has said booster shots are likely not needed for fullyvaccinated otherwise healthy adults without recurring revenue they would appear to be priced too richly moderna  forward pe for a largely onetime even if multiyear windfall

there will also be political pushback against hoarding boosters for wealthy countries if most of the developing world hasnt yet received their initial doses

c future products  no doubt both companies gained brand value from their covid vaccine but future products are still years down the road

 short interest  neither stock has unusually high short interest  bion  moderna so it doesnt appear to be a squeeze

i dont doubt both stocks can be worth  by the end of this decade if they deliver other successful drugs but a neardoubling in a month is crazy  does anyone have some insights",59,"user report

Technical analysis,wallstreetbets,Why Technical Analysis Is (Mostly) BULLSHIT,"too long; didn't read at the bottom

before you all comment sir this is a wendys   i get that this is wallstreetbets and you guys hate long posts and anything useful but back in my day before this place had  million members  people would actually post useful longform stuff and not just memes and loss porn shit i remember for a time we had a lawyer who started a book club and posted extremely longform in depth posts about all kinds of crazy stuff so if anyone is still around from that era or if you are actually interested in learning something that can help you make even slightly more informed decisions stay tuned

this is an interesting sentimenttopic that many tards on wsb echo but very few understand what they are saying or why they are saying it

they simply echo this because they tried to all in their port one time on a stock that was rsi  and lost all their money or maybe they saw some other retard on the front page talking about how the macd crossover meant this stock could not possibly go down again

the point is  most people write off trading indicators and pretty much all forms of technical analysis without really understanding what it is or what it is used for

im going to take a moment to elaborate on why  of the technical analysis you guys see on the internet is complete bullshit  and ill even talk a little bit about how you can use some of it in a nonretarded way



this actually might take longer than a moment i am a retard after all and not great at counting past  so grab some chicken tendies and sit tight

 the basics

to understand why most ta is bullshit first you need to understand what it even is surprisingly most people dont

put simply ta is just about any form of analysis that uses price and volume these are the two building blocks of ta at face value all a technical analyst has at his disposal is price and volume

 the problems  how most traders use ta



continuing on my last point rsi macd and all the other indicators you see are literally just ways of automatically organizing price and volume that our monkey brains couldnt possibly do in real time

they are not supercomputer machine learning algorithms that can save you from blowing up your portfolio depending who you ask they can be beneficial for trading but most people take it all completely out of context

they take something like rsi and think okay when its low i buy  cannot go tits up

now you might be thinking whats the issue when i look at a chart with rsi overlayed it looks pretty darn useful

thats precisely the problem

if you glance at a chart and compare it to lots of indicators  they often appear useful however this is where human psychology and our tendency towards bias comes into play while at a glance it seems simple enough to just buy when macd crosses over  when you actually try this strategy out  you might explode your portfolio

why is this

 an indication to enter a trade is simply one single part of a complete trading system

 it does you absolutely no good without knowing when to take profits what option do you buy if you are trading options how much stock or options do you buy when do you stop loss if the trade is going wrong the point is  there are so many other things that comprise a profitable trading system aside from when to enter  thats the easiest part at face value you have a  chance of being right regardless of what you are using to determine that

 the technical method you are using to indicate when to enter a trade actually has no statistical significance

 remember how i said we have a tendency towards bias when you are looking to go long on a stock your brain is already in confirmation bias mode you already decided to go long you are just looking for the courage to pull the trigger in this state if you take a look at a chart and on that chart buying at rsi  works  of the time  you will likely convince yourself into thinking it works most of the time most technical analysis you see on the internet is cherry picking for confirmation bias
 a final point on statistical significance    or even  data points does not prove statistical significance market conditions constantly change and with them so does what form of trading works and what form of analysis in trading you cant safely assume statistical significance without backtesting something across thousands of data points going back many years and then forward testing it in todays market for the record most indicators by themselves do not have any predictive value like i said before they are just organizing price and volume in a different way in other words they are telling you what you already know but making it more glamorous

 the last surprisingly common issue with how most people do ta is that they do not even take the time to learn how to do the bare minimum properly

 what i mean is  of people on the internet cant even draw a trendline right if you are this far gone  you will have much better luck using your pet geckos dietary habits to determine when to buy and sell most of you probably werent around for that age of wsb

 the solutions  what ta is really used for

now that we have laid out why  of ta on the internet sucks ass  lets hear the other side of the story  and how you can use it in a noncompletelyretarded way the reality is there are not many methods other than ta for trading shortterm income statements and discount cash flow models will do you no good trading options weeklies

when doing shortterm trading  ta can actually be quite useful  so long as you understand the limitations it has

so what are some basic things you can employ to take some usefulness from ta instead of blowing your portfolio up because of it

 stop listening to other peoples analysis do your own fucking research

 if you are going to do it and going to fuck it up at least have the decency to fuck up on your own instead of following dickbusterxxxs inverse head and shoulders setup he posted on wsb after watching a  minute youtube video on what an inverse head and shoulders is its funny how we will do anything we can to avoid actually fucking learning how to do something these days pick up a fucking book or something

 understand ta and indicators are not and will never be an end all be all

 the truth is ta is not a definitive methodology for being a profitable trader its simply a way of plotting a roadmap to make better riskreward trades than you would be able to otherwise sometimes very rarely the riskreward you get from this roadmap in combination with all the other parts of a system i outlined in the last section results in you making a profit
 whether this profit is better than just throwing your money in spy or a profit at all determines on your edge  or what you have to bring to the table that all the other retards arent already doing in other words what you can do differently that sets you apart this is something that comes from thousands of hours staring at charts and studying or researching no one can give it to you the billion dollar renaissance algorithms already arbitraged all the easy shit out

 never make a trade based on a single data point in technical analysis

 remember i said most indicators alone have no predictive value while this is true multiple things lining up can be useful confluence is the lifeblood of technical analysis if you decide to take things further and do some studying or research on the topic make sure you are looking at multiple factors and how they coincide with each other looking at just a single indicator like rsi will never give you an edge

 learn how to separate bias from truth

 what truly separates a good technical analyst from a bad one is their ability to discern what is their emotions trying to confirm what they would like to happen from what is actually a fact the former is what most people do and will do you no good the latter can offer some assistance in picking shortterm trades with favorable riskreward you could literally plot a chart in any number of ways that fits what you would like to happen but there is only one way to plot what is most likely to happen

 conclusion  too long; didn't read

there is no secret magical indicator that is going to make you rich it doesnt exist indicators themselves are not some revelation they are just shit we already know stated differently

most ta on the internet is completely incorrect and retarded but that doesnt mean ta as a whole is completely retarded without it  there really isnt many other ways to make shortterm trades if you want to use it take it with a grain of salt and do it on your own following behind other peoples shitty analysis will do you no good

however ta isnt as easy as watching a youtube video there is no shortcut to being a good trader it requires many hours of studying and practice

if you arent willing to do that  then just stop using it at all  and enter your trades based on whether you or your wifes boyfriend are fucking her that night you will probably save a lot of money",255,"user report

hello apes have not posted a technical analysis in a while last time i posted about ta was on rkt and my price target hit on the dot i was shocked too laugh out loud this time i was looking at the Gamestop Corporation (GME) chart and i noticed something very interesting

 currently we are breaking out of a descending triangle to the upside and the price target for that is 

 i then noticed if we hit the price target of  we are creating a w pattern which has a higher high base the realistic price target of the w pattern would be  but a  could happen as well

 currently volume overall in ma deviation rate macd and the volume bars is very low and stable which indicates a rise in volume and volatility soon this can link to the fact that we are breaking out of a descending triangle

 soon enough with george sherman stepping down as chief executive we can hope the next candidate can sustain Gamestop Corporation (GME) as a company better than sherman did

 last but not least i have to mention the breakout to the downside price target which is  however i think it is highly unlikely for that scenario to play out

please have a look at my ta in the screenshot iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) labeled each indication for you apes to see something other than crayons

too long; didn't read  in the next  weeks expect Gamestop Corporation (GME) to go brrrr   otm calls are finally going to pay xd",5586,i can tell you right now if this thing goes back to  im gonna buy so many fucking shares,colorful tits i like,woohoo at  ill make  per share at that target
Technical analysis,wallstreetbets,$GME Technical Analysis: Waves go Brrr,"hi fam its me fam 

there is something going on with Gamestop Corporation (GME) and it may be  imminent
this is my interpretation of Gamestop Corporation (GME) thru wave countingelliotwave 

refer to this image first  

from a yearly point of view we have accomplished wave a and wave b colored blue for those colored blind I don't know how that works we are in the mist of forming wave c  that will be interpreted in the following paragraph from this standpoint we have strong support level at  fib level priced  it was actually broken but that level was a test to see how far it will go down it found support again twice on several different locations weeks later this is very important because the psychology of the market investors show a threshold and now pointing towards a bullish movement  even though we were consolidating now per elliot wave analysis wave  is the biggest wave of the  wave formation it  must past the high of  in order to be called a elliot wave  or c wave there are several mini resistance levels we must past but as i am typing we pushed past two of them the next important level of all is price  which is surprisingly at fib level  thats a magic number for later we can predict where wave  may end and that number is    math not included 

refer to image 
this image basically tells me half time is over and the bell just rung the pendant is forming or has already formed  its a signal and confirms the psychoanalysis of market retail investors and all that there is a upward movement however there needs to be a stimulus or break out movement out this image now focuses on our micro analysis of wave  c wave  of wave c has completed and assumingly so wave  b of bigger wave  is consolidating pendant quick fib analysis we find resistance at fib level  priced at  then again we have fib level  hovering around price  remember this  important later down the road if we want some kind of breakout we need to close above  followed by some stimulus upward movement factor in addition this pendant formed a higher lows but also lower highs consolidation 

on the daily
 if we close above  thats a great start
 then close above  price movement is building momentum for wave c  which should have the biggest momentum of all  waves
 theoretically it needs to close above  to confirm wave c but remember thats only the smaller version of wave  

if this happens it can theoretically push bigger wave  to around  depends on market volatility and demand to xxxxs 

 too long; didn't read wave s forming there is a pressure on Gamestop Corporation (GME) market and it may be bullish movement from now on consolidation may be done if it can close above micro support levels

Gamestop Corporation (GME) steadily has been producing some great gains this week opening monday bright and early at  and finally opening today at  looking poised to make our moonshot unfortunately after peaking above  after a series of trading halts plummeted down to  with restabilization by eod

to the unexperienced eye and paper hands this looks like a time to sell

 however

to the experienced trader this is a textbook salmon chart lemme explain it clearly to the retarded paper hands here

xb



 but if you look closely a pattern emerges



the sockeye salmon chart movement is a dead giveaway it begins as a massive dip that goes below red to match the color of breeding sockeye then some wacky shit for the ventral fin and we have stabilized at the belly of the fish in the green for approaching the head

 but what about the natural predator of salmon coming to spawn

xb



bears the natural antithesis of salmon and gay bears the antithesis of the retail traders but how have the gay bears forced the stock to plummet what manipulation did they have this time

 you may be familiar to ladder attacks but let me introduce you to fish ladder attacks

 



ladders allow fish to get upstream to spawn wealth despite hedge funds preventing direct uninhibited access

 hedgefunds have stationed gay bears at the ladders to eat the incoming paperhanded salmon which was the primary driver in todays major crash

 but whats that tube representing retail trading



 thats right its salmon tube time

xb



 diamond hands ryan cohen and other big players are literally loading willing salmon into the tube to bypass the gaybears and fish ladder attacks to take us straight to valhalla for our tendie spawn

 prediction graph for the upcoming days

 come take me to the upstream all you gotta do to hodl

was a k equity portfolio margin position that i bought m total of upro and tmf on two x leveraged etfs  upro  tmf i just rebalanced gains from tmf into upro  and it now blew up 

i walked risk management through the positions the spx position is a short box spread financing the margin for the position the other two positions are risk parity positions that i explained to him was much safer than the  stocks and  less correlation than a  stock bond portfolio 

his response your safer portfolio just caused a k margin call


risk management is going to reevaluate their bondstock correlation offsets both in general and for x levered etfs 

anyways im a bit off the hook since the margin loan is due to the market by  dec  and im getting kmo tax free disability risk management was nice enough to give me a  day portfolio margin call to bring the account back up to k positive equity if not the uprotmf positions are liquidated spx remains and i have until the date the short box spread is due at that time ill have a full margin call when the brokers account is on the hook im down to risk reduction only trades 

 i had to provide proof by sending in pay stubs that i really am getting kmo in tax free disability insurance pay 

so im going to pray portfolio goes up otherwise whoever the fuck on the other side of my spx box spread lending me  million at  apr to gamble on stocks is going to wish they bought us treasuries instead

Risk management,wallstreetbets,Rules of Risk Management,"given the current environment and with the past two days wiping out many new traders i feel that it is appropriate to post my rules of risk management which have been requested by others on previous posts

as a former fund manager and traderinvestor with two decades of experience under my belt here are the rules i have developed for myself concerning the trading of options

 never invest with money that you cannot afford to lose this is the cardinal rule of risk management

 limit your overall exposure in any single position this includes multiple directional positions on the same underlying to a maximum percentage of your portfolio that does not exceed  for larger accounts k and  for smaller accounts k and below

 always analyze the direction of implied volatility prior to entering a trade only look at debit strategies when iv percentile is low and only look at credit generating strategies when iv percentile is high in situations where you decide to take a directional trade bullish or bearish the use of spreads is recommended when iv is elevated as this will negate much of the risk associated with both vega volatility decay and theta time decay

 longer time horizons are advisable in selecting expiration dates for debit positions and the use of shorter duration credit spreads can significantly reduce your risk thus elevating your probability of profit

 where liquidity is concerned  only trade options that are highly liquid meaning that they have high open interest and thus tighter bid and ask spreads which will significantly lower the slippage on each trade you take

 asymmetry of risk  only enter debit positions that offer  or more units of potential reward for every unit of risk this means that if youre risking  on a trade your potential return should be at least  for credit positions this is not feasible thus the tradeoff becomes taking in a credit with an exceptionally high probability of profit which provides a positive expected value on the trade for those of you unfamiliar with the term expected value  theres this thing called google

 maintaining a cash position of greater than  of your portfolio value is always advisable i personally maintain  cash at all times you never know when a position is going to go against you or when an exceptional tradeinvestment opportunity will arise thus you want to be in a position of optionality with respect to taking a new favourable position or adjusting an existing one

 scale into your positions by laddering your orders this is especially important for those with larger account sizes since you can attain much better average prices on your positions by buying incrementally or selling credit positions incrementally for example if you have  to allocate to a single position assuming a portfolio value in excess of k you can allocate  in  separate orders or  in  separate orders conversely when selling your positions you should always scale out which will allow you to ride your winners much longer than you normally would by incrementally taking risk off the table which detaches you emotionally from your trade

 manage your emotions and avoid fear of missing out option trading is a strategic game that should be done with much care patience and discipline by managing your emotions and working strategically as a trader you will develop a pattern of decisionmaking which is integral to your profitability and success over a long time horizon fear of missing out is a terrible thing because it causes you to chase trades that have already passed you by focus on your trades not what everyone else is doing 

 put aside money for taxes and live within your means assuming you follow the above rules and have a solid fundamental understanding of how options and the financial markets work you should see profits in the long run which means that you need to be disciplined in squirrelling away money for tax purposes so that jpow and his band of merry morons can continue giving it away to those of you who are living off of everyone else read up on the tax laws where you reside and if youre generating enough profits hire a proper accountant to take care of your taxes for you

bonus rule document all of your trades in a trade journal  if you dm me id be happy to send you a copy of the excel template i use



godspeed and if youre serious about making your money work for you longterm instead of working for your money longterm memorize these rules and apply them or dont and continue chasing tendies like the majority of undisciplined individuals iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) come across while repeatedly saying would you like fries with that

Market trends,wallstreetbets,Understanding Market Trends,"i read a lot of posts in this sub about how retarded the rally was or how retarded bears are and vice versa  but i think that  known vs unknown frame is a better way to undesrtand the changes in market sentiment than bull vs bear  

before the virus was understood the market fell but during its spread as it became better understand the market recovered it recovered even though it was killing thousands of people  that seems ridiculous until you realize how institutional investors approach investing  massive underreaction before the virus then massive overreaction after it in other words either gay bear orgy or stonks go up

the most important info is thus how long does it takes big investors to realize unknownlatent factors it took them two months to absorb the threat of the virus to our credit this sub was a lot quicker than most hedge funds the problem with this sub  is that despite our retarded nature we actually have a somewhat clear view of reality we realize things far too quickly and react prematurely then wonder why the market doesnt catch up

so even though virus rates are rising and consumer demand will not recover and we will be in a depression for years i am betting on calls this week and next week because big investors are too slow and too dull to recognize that just like they were months before the virus buy the dip",25,"it has nothing to do with that it was the fed plain and simple compare the h to the China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (SNP) chart they are perfectly lined up 

the fed doesnt directly buy equities but it does buy treasuries and collatorialize banks and control capitalization requirements and basically the banks were given assurances that if they bought equities the fed would back them and the fed removed there capitalization requirement to  

the fed has slowed down  its balance sheet and so has the market now jpow will go before congress on tuesday and wednesday to say we need more stimulus the fed cannot in all reality print forever they have other tools but there are huge ramifications if they print forever including the threat of the dollar not being a world reserve currency jpow needs congress to give more stimulus but congress which is half controlled by dems is critical of banks that have restricted credit access to the poor in the midst of this and want to see trump fail trump tweets how well the economy is doing and dems know if the market is bad he wont be reelected so they probably want to reign in the fed and limit the member banks

Market trends,wallstreetbets,Gearing Up For Future Market Trends and Preparing A Stress-Free Portfolio,"iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been studying the market across multiple sectors in the past two months my primary focus is in the evgasminingtech sector this post might be more fitting for rinvesting but i hope this can help someone on this forum as well

first off its only suitable for me to preface this with a quick discussion on tesla id like to point out that teslas earnings report was largely good on the cashflow side delivery  guidance numbers  margins its was pleasantly surprised by the cashflow since tesla is developing gigafactories in berlin shanghai and austin which should have tied up some of their cash but it looks like these liabilities were deferred as debt in terms of the carbon credits i think this was a very strategic move to qualify for the sp inclusion and i previously thought it would take  months for companies to become inducted as per usual but a lot of fund managers and analysts predict a much quick inclusion should it be approved my price target for tesla preearnings was  as a i worried much of the quarters catalysts are well baked into its current valuation but am considering buying todays and potentially tomorrows dip should there be one 

on that note id like to discuss the importance of being patient with the current market i think options are great and a lot of fun but it can hurt tremendously if youre too actively trading and without a proper set of hedging strategies to dampen the risk that being said lets first discuss my first pick nickel mining nickel is an incredibly important source of energy and a vital component for lithiumion batteries they are low in cost but high in energy density and largely efficient as im sure many of you are aware elon did mention nickels value in the er conference call and this was preceded by many analysts having expressed interest in the nickel mining market 

xb



currently the market for precious metals are inflated obviously as a result of the rise of digital currency printing the only issue with this is that people are speculating hyperinflation in the forthcoming years should a vaccine fail to realize and until some clarity is established in the coming months i believe gold silver palladium etc are all speculative metals that hold some intrinsic value nickel however is different it is an emerging market in the precious metals category and has long been considered less valuable than its counterparts its only with the rise of the Beverly Enterprises. Inc. (BEV) market that people began to realize the potential and demand for nickel currently there are no environmentally sustainable ways to mine nickel as most of these metals are discovered in the form of lateritic ores which is a combination of metals the only way to extract pure grade nickel in this process is via large earth moving equipment  metallurgy process which has a carbon footprint if mining companies successfully extract nickel via more efficient means and in greater quantities these companies will thrive in the Beverly Enterprises. Inc. (BEV) market 

that being said this is what you guys came for vale BHP Billiton Limited (BHP) lit xme in that order vale is the largest mining for nickels at this moment with a low market cap BHP Billiton Limited (BHP) is a sizeable mining corporation with the means to increase their nickel extraction beyond that of vale should they commit this route lit is the etf for lithium batteries industry xme is an etf for mining companies of which many deal with nickel extraction buy shares go long and stop stressing every am in the morning life is for living

also cost average down on tesla should it drop or rise its an attractive point still despite its high valuation long any energy companies associated with tesla ie sunrun vivint etc  but wait for consolidation or cost average down if you have the capital",70,"this is why we invented blogs do you know what a blog is

yahoo bought tumblr for  billion its worth a bit less than that now","nickel is so uncertain to invest in right now i think the Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) market is right in the middle of deciding whether to go lithium iron phosphate lfp or nickel based liion everything else 

tesla talked briefly on this and said they will still need nickel for highend products like the semitruck but their shanghai model  sr already used catl lfp batteries Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD) second largest Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) manufacturer after tesla has also recently said theyre abandoning all future plans of expanding nickel based liion and will only be building capacity for lfp cells in the future 

lfp is energy dense enough to power a car like model y to fit the long range version maybe you need to do some internal reworking but it should be in the same range 

in my opinion every car under k will only be using lfp nickel will be reserved for higher end cars like the model sx or semi i dont think this demand for luxury cars is really high enough to move nickel demand enough stainless steel uses a ton of nickel so theres plenty of current supply that can be redirected to batteries if needed 



although theres a chance lfp takes over the highend market as well its way more thermally stable and really cant catch fire like all nickel based batteries has the potential to do theoretically charging with lfp can also be done much faster a lfp model y should be able to be charged    in about  minutes a nickel based model s will need at least  minutes just like smartphones 

would you want a  mile car that charges in  minutes or a  mile carsemi that takes  min to charge are you ready to pay x the price for the  mile car 

that said if theres attractive undervalued nickel lithium companies right now you could probably make some nice gains if they have a low market cap for lithium i just think the current main way of extracting lithium by letting the sun evaporate salt water in a large pond is kinda retarded if theres a company that has a st century approach for lithium mining from salt brine thats definitely something to look out for 

in heavy speculation territory finding a company thats developing ways of extraction lithium from sea water through desalination could be a niche play water desalination is like almost all electricity costs and today power costs are about x the cost of lithium this still puts a hard upper limit on lithium prices with lithium only being  of the battery material manufacturers would be able to absorb the cost 

make a ton of cheap solar panels in hot Astoria Financial Corporation (AF) areas run water desalination plants to remove salt from water sell the clean water to local area extract lithium from salt and sell it to tesla use lithium to build batteries and use them to store solar energy for night time use sand and electricity to build solar panels

stock,wallstreetbets,Robinhood Stock Lending Experience,"too long; didn't read how much can you make about  not    annually almost nothing

im sharing my experience with robinhood stock lending because it was very hard to find information online about how much you can make

robinhood states  stocks with low market availability and high demand are more likely to be borrowed

i owned about  shares of a low volume stock that had a short squeeze in the month of february it went up about  and had x more than the average volume on many of those days thus i think the month of february encapsulates what would probably be the best month to loan out my stock

throughout february i owned about k to k with all shares loaned out for every day of february

from february i earned a whopping  and  cents just to be clear thats approx conservatively a  annual rate

so this is nothing at least with the amount of stock i own and the question becomes is it worth it for my stock to be loaned out to short sellers who are going to manipulate the stock i believe in and also apply downward price pressure for me thats not worth it and i turned off stock lending

according to robinhood they determine how much you make by a rebate rate that is  of the weighted average rebate rate we earned by lending that stock to borrowers on that day per my understanding this means they loaned it out with about  interest which makes sense

but  robinhood thats way too low its our moneyproperty after all want us to take the risk that you default which check notes  and let stockvote manipulators bet against our own companies  is too lowrobinhood stock lending experience",149,"user report

Stock market,Forex,"Market Prediction Algorithms for the US Dollar, the Stock Market and Bitcoin","this book provides an intricate example of how to apply pattern recognition to the daily prediction of tradeable financial assets like eurousd and bitcoinusd i demonstrate how the only way to be able to predict the price movement on a daily basis is by strictly using variations in positions of the  moon  sun  mercury   lunar nodesand setting those variations within different parameters that call for predictions of either a price rise or fallusing parameters that call for predictions of either up or down based on variations of the position of the sun moon mercury and lunar nodes one can find significant patterns that could lead to predicting accurately a tradeable financial asset on a daily basis for a long period of timepossibly leading to a holy grail algorithm or holy grail theory of daily trading via quantitative analysis

the book also demonstrates how the dow jones industrial average follows a pattern based on the position of the sun and lunar nodes the basic gist of the algorithm decrees that from the point when the degree of the sun is  degrees pastor higher than the degree of the lunar nodein any sign all the way until the degree of the sun enters a new sign at the th degree markusing western astrology a prediction of a market upswing should be applied from the point when the degree of the sun enters a new sign at the th degree mark all the way until the degree of the sun goes  degrees past the degree of the lunar nodein any sign the prediction of a market downswing should be applied

basically you first need some type of behaviour or pattern that you notice repeats often and then set rules and backtest that is the only way to define a consistent strategy never break your rules and if you took the time to backtest it and forward test it then you know the stats and what you can expect

basics

 why are you doing this i dont trade this strategy anymore due to a pivot in my trading objectives several years ago i learned the basic concepts from others so im giving back what iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) received it doesnt compete with my current style or the approach of the proprietary trading firm i work for this strategy has sat dormant on my computer for the better part of a decade so i figured why not dust it off and pass it on in terms of why now iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) noticed an uptick in strategy  questions on reddit and iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) started writing answers but stopped because its just too much for a single comment my plan is to reference this post in future interactions with traders
 how do we know this works i could show  and i could give  but at the end of the day all that can be faked my goal is to hand you something which works  provided you are looking for a method and are willing to put in the effort needed to make it work after reading this post there literally is nothing stopping you from adopting this backtesting it and trading it so let the method speak for itself

lets do this thing

strategy brief

in brief the strategy seeks to participate in an existing trend when momentum picks up in the direction of the trend initial stops are tight and are trailed with pullbacks until momentum ends i traded the strategy on the daily timeframe but it certainly could have been applied to others as well

   bought into fresh withtrend momentum sold when momentum ended
   bought into fresh withtrend momentum sold when momentum ended
   bought into fresh withtrend momentum sold when momentum ended

there are two key concepts here  trend and momentum lets define them and then get into exact entry and exit techniques

trend

put simply a trend is when price is moving in a certain direction while price swings are in agreement with that general move

 uptrend  in an uptrend price swings are making higher highs and higher lowers  
 downtrend  in a downtrend price swings are making lower lows and lower highs  

the market doesnt always trend and there are ugly trends out there this strategy avoids those times in which the trend is not in force to only focus on environments which favor continuation of an existing trend

trend momentum

in any trend there is a cycle of with trend momentum followed by against trend momentum this forms the pattern of price pushing to fresh extremes in a trend followed by pullbacks against the trend

when the trend reexerts itself you tend to see an explosion of withtrend strength you can identify these points on a chart by big candles in the direction of the overall trend

   a downtrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of pullback and the continuation of the trend
   an uptrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of the pullback and the continuation of the trend
   a downtrend was in force and these momentum bars marked the end of the pullback and continuation of the trend

and thats really the conceptual backdrop of the strategy we find a trend that is in a pullback and look to enter on fresh momentum in the direction of the trend you can train your eyes to spot these patterns within a couple of hours of study its not rocket science

entry criteria

as per the entry the concepts spell out precisely when to look to enter the market find an uptrend look for a pullback then buy when you get withtrend strength

as per my specific entry criteria i entered with a stop above the market in an uptrend or below the market in a downtrend for example if i identified unfolding momentum in an uptrend i would set an entry order a few pips beyond the high to get me into the trade

   buy stop set above the momentum bar in the direction of the trend
   sell stop set below the momentum bar in the direction of the trend

exit initial stop

as you can see by   this strategy gets stopped out a lot

the reason for this is that i am seeking to capture the entire unfolding trend by risking only a small amount to maximize my average win  average loss ratio the goal here is to make the rewardrisk ratio such that when i actually captured a trend it would compensate me several times over for losing trades this is very much a trend following strategy designed to deliver outstanding returns when the market trends and scrape along when it doesnt so the initial stop loss is very tight so as to maximize the reward per unit of risk when the trend cooperates

for an initial stop loss i set it roughly halfway into the width of the momentum bar if the momentum bar is narrow in relation to the recent trading range then i would set the stop beneath the momentum bar

   stoploss set somewhere near the middle of the candle
   stoploss set somewhere near the middle of the candle

exit trailing profit

the stop loss remains in place until the market forms and completes a pullback in the trend when a pullback has been completed and the trend continues the stop loss is moved to the bottom of the pullback in an uptrend or the top of the pullback in a downtrend this process is repeated until the stop is hit and you are taken out of the trade in other words you have very high upside potential on each trade with constrained but much more probable risk

   trailing stops are set beneath pullbacks when a pullback completes by pushing into new highs this process is repeated until you are stopped out
   this looks complicated but its really not every time the market forms a pullback of  or more bars we wait until price closes beyond the pullback in the direction of the trend and then move our stop to the bottom of the pullback

risk management

to protect against losses i risked a firm  per trade if my initial stop was hit i would trade at such a size that i would lose  of my account balance no exceptions

the reason here is that with a trend following strategy under this riskreward framework you are going to lose a lot you need to ensure that you can survive  losses straight with minimal dent to your trading book and you only do this through risk management

indicators for screening

if you notice on my charts which show actual trades i had the  period moving average and the  moving average overlaid on the chart the reason for this is that i used the  period sma as an scanning indicator and the  as a general reference for the trend

  period sma  i used this indicator to screen for momentum bars example if todays close is the first close above the sma and were closing in the top  of the candle then visually inspect the chart to see if were in a trend and this is fresh momentum in the direction of the trend
  period sma  this indicator gave me a quick ataglance metric to give context to my trend analysis if i viewed price as in a trend i wanted it to be above the  as a loose confirmation that the general trend was indeed upwards

my primary focus was on price action find a trend trade fresh withtrend momentum when it appears and then ride the trend until it ends the indicators simply served as a helpful scanning tool and you can trade the method without them

practical considerations for real trading

practice and trade review

you have to internalize this to actually identify it in real time if you want to adopt this strategy you do this through backtesting and verification that your live testing is lining up with your backtest

 backtesting  i spent hundreds of hours dragging charts one bar at a time and recording trades that i would have taken if it were realtime on an ongoing basis i would backtest  backtrade the past decade of data for every instrument i traded this practically meant that i was spending  of my time sharpening my trading edge through backtest and  of my time actually trading if you havent quite figured out trading id suggest you put in serious effort into the area of backtest and intentional practice
 trade review  on an ongoing basis i would do a complete review of all of my trades to figure out how to sharpen my edge and to verify that i was perfectly trading my plan  no matter your strategy i believe trade review is crucial how will you know if youre making mistakes if youre not reviewing what youve done how will you know if you can do better if youre not carefully questioning each and every trade to try and get better this sheet has several more columns and was just one iteration of an ongoing review process

if this seems like a lot of work thats the point you are competing against some of the brightest minds in the world why would the market allow trading to be as easy as opening an app on your way to the beach to profitability trade you really need to invest heavily in  verifying that what youre doing has a history of making money and  verifying that youre actually executing in perfect alignment with your testing as well as looking for ways to improve performance youll always see the lucky dude flaunting his returns but for the vast majority of professional traders this is just scratching the surface of the types of analysis you need to do to monitor and improve your discretionary trading edge

psychology

theres no getting around it trading is psychologically difficult for many people my two silver bullets are an edge and a desire to succeed

 you must have an edge first off do you have an edge unless you have a either a demonstrated track record of making money or a backtest of your exact method showing that it makes money then youll probably have mental angst even with my trades resting on hundreds of hours of study and backtesting demonstrating the validity of my method it was still difficult to pull the trigger and take the next trade at times knowing i had a demonstrated edge is what gave me the confidence to overcome mental angst and put on the next trade
 you must have a desire to succeed and second bullet is this do you want to succeed if you have a demonstrated edge and have a rock solid conviction and drive to succeed then a lot of psychological issues take care of themselves i remember the pain of sitting in a prolonged drawdown after losing several trades in a row it was a defining moment for me it is a unique pain that words cant quite capture in the depths of the pain of losing trade after trade and in the process worrying if id lose my job i reminded myself that  i have an edge and  i really want to succeed at this so i picked myself back up and took the next trade and over the next few months i delivered some of my strongest returns and broke into new equity highs

in my opinion people get the cart before the horse in the territory of psychology trading gurus seem to suggest that if you get your mindset aligned money will just flow into your account thats simply not the case if the places in which you are buying and selling have zero demonstrated ability to actually make money step  get a demonstrated edge step  ensure youre able to act on that edge through proper psychology

an edge

the expected value equation is the foundation of trading put simply

 expected value  win percentage x average win size  loss percentage  average loss size

if that equation is negative you dont have an edge if its positive you have an edge if you play around with the math youll see that win ratio or average win  loss size in isolation are irrelevant you can have a high win ratio with large losers or a low win ratio with large winners and have the exact same mathematical edge the only thing youre varying is the distribution of your returns

my strategy detailed above is a positive skew strategy lots of small losses and a few very large wins you can adapt it by either larger stops or adding targets to change your distribution of returns the underlying edge is real markets trend and at certain points you can participate in them to outperform the baseline drift of the market how you size your targets and stops shapes the ultimate distribution of returns you will receive as you capture this edge

further reading

for those who have traded for a while everything i said above probably clicks and makes sense but if this was like me speaking an entirely different language heres some books that are simply excellent for discretionary trading

 the art and science of technical analysis  adam grimes this book will carefully show you how to read market structure and give strategies for trading it grimes is the realdeal and his antihype levelheadedness is much needed in trading literature if you can only afford one book make it this one
 the psychology of trading  dr brett steenbarger hands down the best psychology book out there in my view steenbarger a professional psychologist who has worked at the institutional level of trading is who fixed my thinking on trading psychology to where i focused on getting an edge first and foremost and then aligning my psychology so that i can act on my edge

conclusion

take it or leave it theres a complete discretionary trading strategy which was used at the professional level of the field of speculative fx trading this is one of many approaches out there and if youre looking for a strategy feel free to take this one and experiment with it best of luck in all of your endeavors",99,"great summary this is the real strategy for all you newbies out there

as you can see by my win ratio  this strategy gets stopped out a lot

 negative win rate and still profitable yes this is probably one of the only ways to consistently make money  you lose quite often but when you win you cover all your losses and some more  forget about strategies which have rr higher than  and winrate higher than 

 i was spending  of my time sharpening my trading edge through backtest and  of my time actually trading

 finally this is what trading is about  its a numbers game and a lot of awful boring and mentally exhausting work the actual trading  monitoring needs very little time entries are not that important especially all those sniper entries  that is just pure gambling and nothing more exit strategy is because noone knows how strong the trend will be once it starts who would say  days ago that gold would suddenly make  pips in a week

now the next step for this or any strategy would be to show people how to actually optimize the strategy optimization  finding optimal stop loss and take profit values for the data set created by the strategy expanding strategy to other assets this can be easily done in any sheets program like excel or google sheets once you enter all the data from backtest",we need more people to post stuff like this and not just Protective Life Corporation (PL) screenshots thanks for showing people a potentially useful strategy,i have a similar algo to trade like this even recently confirm it worked but it really depends on which instruments will get the most out of profit for me it will be us and us actually it will be the best if you can combine this breakout strategy with a mean reversion strategy to smooth out E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD)
Trading strategy,Forex,"Is ""feeling it"" a trading strategy?",i mean you always hear you need to have strategy but i wonder if there is anyone else like me that kinda just feels it and enters based on gut feeling and some basic resistances,3,some argue its the only real way to be profitable i dont necessarily agree but i have had thoughts about those being profitable with systems are more dependant on their feel and experience than the actual system without  realizing it to the full extent themselves,"feeling is emotional a better way to describe it would be experience when you first start driving you will have to really focus to keep the car straight between the lines watch your mirrors and maintain speed once youve been driving for a while it becomes second nature youve gained experience like trading this doesnt apply to everyone

its not a strategy but most of my trades start with ah yes National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) wants to go through that level"
Trading strategy,Forex,"My forex trading strategy works, but doesn't. Any advice?","so the first time i traded with a strategy was with doyle exchanges course  years ago uses supplydemand sd zones with breaks of structure liquidity and gaps as confluence i found short term success but didnt have strict rulesmy psychology was bad and holiday season lowered my win i fell in love with doyles method of trading but struggled to make it work for me and yes i tried his discord group for a while and long story short it didnt help enough

i started only trading nas i focused on high probability Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP) sd zones and liquidity grabs sweepsreversals at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) open taking most of the setups that occurred its sept  ish and i started backtesting and building a trading plan i found the app airtable and still use it to this day to record my trades the more forwardbacktesting i did the more details i started paying attention to the more confusing my researchstrategy got i wasnt recording effectivelytracking trade characteristics separately and therefor couldnt analyze the data very well on top of realizing that trading the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) open is risky has many fakeouts and isnt backtestable since it goes back and forth in seconds

i took a break during holiday szn and feb  i was back at the drawing board i began looking at nas gu eu and AngloGold Ashanti Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (AU) and how i could filter out the bad trades i always traded the m but now used h and m as confluence looking at highs lowsliquidity and gaps as profit targets rather than amount of money by march i realized the higher time frames confused me and i had no idea what a good vs bad trade was i backtested nas eu uj gu and every setup that occured from janmarch  constructed a trading plan and by may  was ready to forward test on only uj and gu but still record every trade from nas and eu as well to have more data 

my whole journey i had psychology trouble choosing what setups to take or avoid i will attach a pic of my trading plan and an example or  follow me on ig  shambpagne if you wanna see summaries of my trading since may but i was focused on removing the decision making in trading using data to create rules that filtered my trades so i could simply take every trade i saw that fit the criteria win or lose my psychology since has been great  recorded trades later the strategy has been profitable the past  months on paper averages around  trades a week survived a slump in junejuly wo losing most of profits gained in aprilmay and has been tweaked a lil bit based on the data i have analyzed 

that all sounds good but have i been profitable forward testing this strat not exactly in may i was breaking rules and in most of junejulyaugust i was moving into an apt travelling working and only back tested i have forward tested all sept  and realized i havent been tracking news and it can only really be recorded when you forward test and see the affects realtime so im sure a nice chunk of the profits iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) recorded wouldnt exist Brunswick Corporation (BC) of news i never took news into account since it seemed to go in my favor almost just as much as it didnt since iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been forward testing and holding my trades through news i realize its not realistic to think i will be able to consistently take profits in the mere seconds i have during a news candle or that i wont lose more money than my sl says i will cus volatility i decided to just start closing trades right before news hits but i also realized commissions are kinda fucking me over i was up about  this past week on paper risking trade but only actually made  theres no way of telling in the  trades i recorded how much profits wouldve been erased from commissions but obviously a nice chunk it seems

so now here i am rethinking the past  months i have spent dialing in on this strategy im comfortable using wondering how much of it was a waste i dont really want to switch strategies and have another learning curve my data shows that theres only a couple more ways to filter out bad trades and increase win around  rn but i know the filtering would require me to start making decisions and could hurt my psychology and it honestly doesnt seem worth it since i would lose alot of profits on paper for a small win increase i have heard there are no commissions for trading nas but my strat straight up sucks on nas and i cant go back to what i was doing before since it wasnt working i understand swing trading would kinda eliminate this problem but i hate swing trading im a scalper at heart

i am going to keep forward testing the strat and i do still have confidence i will have enough profits in the long run to cover for all the commissions but it is a bit troublesome anyone else dealt with this issue any advice on what to do moving forward assuming my strat wont provide enough in the long term

my stop loss is above the zone and i close early if any candle closes above the open of my entry candle has cut my losses down by less than half instead of taking a full hit your welcome for that one laugh out loud

 while some brokers offer otc vanilla options that you trade against them as the counterparty they are often very limited in selection and have wide spreads youll have a hard time paying the fair price that means implied fair value or being filled at a price between the bid and ask going the otc route at a retail fx broker because theyll likely only execute when you cross the spread or the market moves through your order sadly until theres more competition on the retail level for otc vanilla options this is not gonna change examples here are ig and saxo neither i would recommend so stick with points  and  for exchange traded options

if you want to understand the macro economics where you will find your biggest edge in my experience and you are a chad id read wealth of nations by adam smith to start","forex market is driven mostly by  factors interest rates  inflation

there are actually  factors to keep track of  checkout these yt shorts


dont try to be an economist just learn the minimum which impact trading markets 

i reference these thesw videos all the time for easy recall

i use two easy lists as my goto guide for what fundamentals affects fx market

list  

 economic indicators 
 monetary policy 
 aggregate supplydemand 
 highlow yield currencies and
 sentiment  intermarket analysis


list  

 exportsimports 
 economic indicators 
 financial attractiveness 
 central bank policy 
 state of countrys reserves

can u see the overlap the minimum

at the highest level the strength of an economy is based on domestic  foreign factors to country

 strong country strength  strong fx value
 weak country strength  weak fx value

 country strength comes from domestic money productivity inside country  resulting gdp
 country strength from foreign money international investment into country increasing productivity

interest rates  inflation drive currency strength  hence fx market

compare  high interests rates vs middle rates vs low interest rates

compare  high inflation vs middle inflation vs low inflation 

interest rates are used by a countrys central bank to control the strength of country  currency value in fx markets

always remember the central banks role is  fold

 set monetary policy  
 monitor economy is on track using economic indicators
 stabilise currency value 
 control flow of money inout of country 

 i paraphrased here is fuller list 
 if its not overkill  websites support ur fx fundamentals 

inflation is the price difference btwn supply  demand at country level high inflation bigger difference btwn sd lower inflationsmaller difference btwn sd

high interest rates good for borrowing bad for loans investment  vs middle interest rate good good vs low interest rate bad for borrowing good for loans investment

inflation in middle good for country inflation at extremes too low inflation or too high inflation  bad for country

now hopefully u can see fx currency market is a direct insight into a countrys strength

while  main levers represent fx fundamentals really only  levers indicators interest rates  inflation do the heavy lifting in moving fx market

kiss  keep it super simple"
Fundamental analysis,Forex,"Fellow forex traders (beginners especially), do your fundamental analysis.","i started trading by learning technical analysis i didnt do too well with that and as soon as i started doing my fundamental analysis my learning curve peaked i also got a lot more consistent with my profit 

if you are a technical analysis only trader and that works for you thats great i have nothing against that but if you been grinding technical analysis and it didnt well or you just began trading fundamental analysis might very well be what you needed 

even if youre profitable with just technical analysis from my very own experience without fundamental you could be missing half of the picture or not able to understand whats causing these movement i have seen a lot of people came here and complaint about market manipulation when the reality was there was a big news they missed

there are techniques on doing fundamental analysis and research for example you need to read from multiple trusted sources not just one they should be knowledgeable in finance and economy not just some rando with a youtube account also be aware that none of them can predict the future but when you read heard from enough of them you will gain a lot of insight into market sentiment on what condition are they looking to buy and sell

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been doing past trend analysis based solely on technicals and while deliberately avoiding news and it seems like certain trends are definitely predictable without needing an underlying understanding of the fundamentals

obs english isnt my first language but i hope it makes sense",2,"stop loss be   and by doing so you have  trades in that account  

bump the capital to  and only using  thats  divide  by  thats  trades in that account not accounting for margin calls and stop out ofcourse

using  will give you  trades of that capital all you now need to do based on this is make a strategy that if you trade  times at the end of  trades you profit more than loss

this is just an example  the capital could be larger but the    trade  risk management is constant  makes the number of trade even less

ps  trades does not need to be limited to a month its more like a  months to a year","and also as the number of trades go down by the risk management percentage lets say  you have to make sure that your win rate is impeccable as the example earlier

 letting stops breathe

we talked earlier about giving a position enough room to breathe so it is not stopped out in daytoday noise

lets consider the chart below and imagine you had a trailing stop it would be super painful to miss out on the wider move just because you left a stop that was too tight

xb



one simple technique is simply to look at your chosen chart  lets say daily bars and then look at previous trends and use the measuring tool those generally look something like this and then you just click and drag to measure

for example if we wanted to bet on a downtrend on the chart above we might look at the biggest retracement on the previous uptrend that max drawdown was about  pips or just under  so youd want your stop to be able to withstand at least that 

if market conditions have changed  for example if cvix has risen  and daily ranges are now higher you should incorporate that if you know a big event is coming up you might think about that too the human brain is a remarkable tool and the power of the eyeball method is not to be dismissed this is how most discretionary traders do it

there are also more analytical approaches

some look at the average true range AptarGroup, Inc. (ATR) this attempts to capture the volatility of a pair typically averaged over a number of sessions it looks at three separate measures and takes the largest reading think of this as a moving average of how much a pair moves

for example below shows the daily move in eurusd was around  pips before spiking to  pips in march conditions were clearly far more volatile in march accordingly you would need to leave your stop further away in march and take a correspondingly smaller position size

xb



professional traders tend to use standard deviation as a measure of volatility instead of AptarGroup, Inc. (ATR) there are advantages and disadvantages to both averages are useful but can be misleading when regimes switch see above chart

once you have chosen a measure of volatility stop distance can then be backtested and optimised for example does x AptarGroup, Inc. (ATR) work best or x AptarGroup, Inc. (ATR) for a given style and time horizon 

discretionary traders may still eyeball the AptarGroup, Inc. (ATR) or standard deviation to get a feeling for how it has changed over time and what normal feels like for a chosen study period  daily weekly monthly etc 

xb

 reasons to change a stop

as a general rule you should be disciplined and not change your stops remember  losers average losers this is really hard at first and were going to look at that in more detail later

there are some good reasons to modify stops but they are rare

one reason is if another risk management process demands you stop trading and close positions well look at this later in that case just close out your positions at market and take the lossgains as they are

another is event risk if you have some big upcoming data like non farm payrolls that you know can move the market   pips and you have no edge going into the release then many traders will take off or scale down their positions theyll go back into the positions when the data is out and the market has quietened down after fifteen minutes or so this is a matter of some debate  many traders consider it a coin toss and argue you win some and lose some and it all averages out

trailing stops can also be used to lock in profits we looked at those before as the trade moves in your favour say up if you are long the stop loss ratchets with it this means you may well end up stopping out at a profit  as per the below example

xb



it is perfectly reasonable to have your stop loss move in the direction of pnl this is not exposing you to more risk than you originally were comfortable with it is taking less and less risk as the trade moves in your favour trendfollowers in particular love trailing stops

one final question traders ask is what they should do if they get stopped out but still like the trade should they try the same trade again a day later for the same reasons nope look for a different trade rather than getting emotionally wed to the original idea

lets say a particular stock looked cheap based on valuation metrics yesterday you bought it went down and you got stopped out well it is going to look even better on those same metrics today maybe the market just doesnt respect value at the moment and is driven by momentum wait it out

otherwise why even have a stop in the first place

 entering and exiting winning positions

take profits are the opposite of stop losses they are also  resting orders left with the broker to automatically close your position if it reaches a certain price 

imagine im long eurusd at  if it hits a previous high of   pips higher i will leave a sell order to take profit and close the position

the rookie mistake on take profits is to take profit too early one should start from the assumption that you will win on no more than half of your trades therefore you will need to ensure that you win more on the ones that work than you lose on those that dont 

xb



this is going to be the exact opposite of what your emotions want you to do we are going to look at that in the psychology of trading chapter

remember let winners run just like stops you need to know in advance the level where you will close out at a profit then let the trade happen dont override yourself and let emotions force you to take a small profit a classic mistake to avoid

the trader puts on a trade and it almost stops out before rebounding as soon as it is slightly in the money they spook and cut out instead of letting it run to their original take profit do not do this

 entering positions with limit orders

that covers exiting a position but how about getting into one

take profits can also be left speculatively to enter a position sometimes referred to as bids buy orders or offers sell orders imagine the price is  and the recent low is  

you might wish to leave a bid around  to enter a long position if the market reaches that price this way you dont need to sit at the computer and wait

again typically traders will use tech analysis to identify attractive levels again  other traders will cluster with your orders just like the stop loss we need to bake that in 

so this time if we know everyone is going to buy around the recent low of  we might leave the take profit bit a little bit above there at  to ensure it gets done sure it costs  more pips but how mad would you be if the low was  and then it rallied a hundred points and you didnt have the trade on

there are two more methods that traders often use for entering a position

scaling in is one such technique lets imagine that you think we are in a longterm bulltrend for audusd but experiencing a brief retracement you want to take a total position of  aud and dont have a strong view on the current price action

you might therefore leave a series of five bids of  as the price moves lower each one gets hit the nice thing about scaling in is it reduces pressure on you to pick the perfect level of course the risk is that not all your orders get hit before the price moves higher and you have to trade atmarket

pyramiding is the second technique pyramiding is for take profits what a trailing stop loss is to regular stops it is especially common for momentum traders

xb



again lets imagine were bullish audusd and want to take a position of  aud

here we add  when our first signal is reached then we add subsequent clips of  when the trade moves in our favour we are waiting for confirmation that the move is correct

obviously this is quite nice as we humans love trading when it goes in our direction however the drawback is obvious we havent had the full amount of risk on from the start of the trend

you can see the attractions and drawbacks of both approaches it is best to experiment and choose techniques that work for your own personal psychology as these will be the easiest for you to stick with and build a disciplined process around

 riskreward and win ratios

be extremely skeptical of people who claim to win on  of trades most traders will win on roughly  of trades and lose on  of trades this is why risk management is so important

once you start keeping a trading journal youll be able to see how the winloss ratio looks for you until then assume youre typical and that every other trade will lose money

if that is the case then you need to be sure you make more on the wins than you lose on the losses you can see the effect of this below

xb



a typical rule of thumb is that a ratio of  works well for most traders 

that is if you are prepared to risk  pips on your stop you should be setting a take profit at a level that would return you  pips 

one neednt be religious about these numbers   pips and  pips would be perfectly fine   but they are a guideline 

again  you should still use technical analysis to find meaningful chart levels for both the stop and take profit dont just blindly take your stop distance and do x the pips on the other side as your take profit use the ratio to set approximate targets and then look for a relevant resistance or support level in that kind of region

 riskadjusted returns

not all returns are equal suppose you are examining the track record of two traders now both have produced a return of  over the year not bad

the first trader however made hundreds of small bets throughout the year and his cumulative pnl looked like the left image below

the second trader made just one bet  he sold cadjpy at the start of the year  and his pnl looked like the right image below with lots of large drawdowns and volatility



if you were investing money and betting on who would do well next year which would you choose of course all sensible people would choose the first trader yet if you look only at returns one cannot distinguish between the two both are up  at that point in time this is where the sharpe ratio helps 

a high sharpe ratio indicates that a portfolio has better riskadjusted performance one cannot sensibly compare returns without considering the risk taken to earn that return 

if i can earn  of the return of another investor at only  of the risk then a rational investor should simply leverage me at x and enjoy  of the return at the same level of risk

this is very important in the context of execution advisor algorithms Energy East Corporation (EAS) that are popular in the retail community you must evaluate historic performance by its riskadjusted return  not just the nominal return incidentally look at the sharpe ratio of ones that have been live for a year or more 

otherwise an ea developer could produce two Energy East Corporation (EAS) the first simply buys at  leverage on january st  and the second sells in the same manner at the end of the year one of them will be discarded and the other will look incredible its riskadjusted return however would be abysmal and the odds of repeated success are similarly poor

 sharpe ratio

the sharpe ratio works like this 

 it takes the average returns of your strategy
 it deducts from these the riskfree rate of return ie the rate anyone could have got by investing in us government bonds with very little risk
 it then divides this total return by its own volatility  the more smooth the return the higher and better the sharpe the more volatile the lower and worse the sharpe

for example say the return last year was  with a volatility of  and us bonds are trading at  that gives  or a sharpe ratio of  as a rule of thumb a sharpe ratio of above  would be considered decent for a discretionary retail trader above  is excellent

you dont really need to know how to calculate sharpe ratios good trading software will do this for you it will either be available in the system by default or you can add a plugin

 Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR)

Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR) is another useful measure to help with drawdowns it stands for value at risk normally people will use  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR) conservative or  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR) aggressive lets say youre long eurusd and using  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR) the system will look at the historic movement of eurusd it might spit out a number of 

xb



this means it is expected that on  days out of  hence the  the portfolio will lose  or more this can help you manage your capital by taking appropriately sized positions typically you would look at Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR) across your portfolio of trades rather than trade by trade

sharpe ratios and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR) dont give you the whole picture though legendary fund manager howard marks of oaktree notes that while tools like Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR) and sharpe ratios are helpful and absolutely necessary the best investors will also overlay their own judgment 

investors can calculate risk metrics like Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR) and sharpe ratios we use them at oaktree theyre the best tools we have but they shouldnt put too much faith in them the bottom line for me is that risk management should be the responsibility of every participant in the investment process applying experience judgment and knowledge of the underlying investmentshoward marks of oaktree capital

what hes saying is dont misplace your common sense do use these tools as they are helpful however you cannot fully rely on them both assume a normal distribution of returns whereas in real life you get black swans  events that should supposedly happen only once every thousand years but which actually seem to happen fairly often 

these outlier events are often referred to as tail risk dont make the mistake of saying well the model said  overlay what the model is telling you with your own common sense and good judgment

Economic indicators,Forex,What Economic Indicators or News do you look for when doing Fundamental Analysis,"i am a complete beginner when it comes to forex

xb

so my questions are does technical analysis already price in the fundamentals of a currency for example would a strategy based on ta break because of news release do you follow news by central banks look at gdp and cpi what news or macroeconomic numbers do you look for during trading or is that irrelevant when youre trading on a short time frame like the m or m chart",1,"guys do not shoot me up here this is just my experience

no technical analysis ta has not already priced in the fundamentals fa ta simply shows the results of fa and what happened ta cannot predict what fa will do next it can only show what it has done not what it will do because an institutional trader could not care less about support this or stochastic that price is being moved for reasons at the economic geopolitical and yes central bank level ta cant predict any of that here is a wiki that will explain your exact question and show why it is not true  

your second question yes ta will absolutely break because of a news release no question happens almost everyday simply go to a forex calendar and look at the times of high impact data releases for whatever currency then take a look if the ta held true doing the work for yourself will answer your questions

your third question for me absolutely i follow all those things central banks gdp cpi etc because that is what the masters of the forex trading universe follow and base their decisions on people are ridiculous to think that some chap with hundreds of billions of dollars at whatever big name bank or fund is going to be looking at stochastic rsi ichimoku triangle patterns or whatever other retail shmuck thing that is on offer the only reason they would look at anything retail would be to see that there is a nice liquidity trap that they can use to help fill their large order other than those manipulations they are basing all their trading decisions on fundamental or sentiment reasons

stock,Forex,Why do people say Forex is harder than Stock?,i find it opposite,67,"in stock you can bet on a good company like pepsi

if you place your money in pepsi and dont look at it for  years it will go up maybe not by a lot but it will go up why because as long as the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA) dont get nuked which would mean the entire world would get nuke then pepsi will remain strong because its growth is linked to population growth since its a staple product

xb

now im not telling you to invest in pepsi but in the stock market without any index found for diversification company like pepsi exist

what about forex if you buy the can dollars now and wait  years in the best case senario it will be valued less than today because of inflation

theres  long term growth in forex

you can do  month macro plays sometime but you have to watch what the fuck you are doing because growth only come from volatility shift and short term gains

 in stocks  equities in the us market is open for  hours a day  days a week forex trades

 you can trade forex at night  in the morning  when youre not working a  you cant do that with stocks 

 generally forex trading is more profitable than trading stocks though generally more risky with forex i can easily make  on a trade consistently  of position size where as with stocks youd be lucky to consistently make  or  on your positions on a consistent basis sure this changes with iptions but options have way more risk than forex 

 with forex you dont have to get into company financials or any of that speculative nonsense there are a limited number of quality currency pairs that everyone trades and they all move off the same economic data  signals in different ways

Stock market,options,I analyzed the last 3 decades of stock market returns to determine if it makes sense to time the market! Here are the results!,"we have all heard it  time in the market beats timing the market

at the same time we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market the market always seems to break some new alltime high records so we wait for the inevitable crashpullback to invest its high time we put both strategies to test basically what i wanted to analyze was

whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested

analysis

for this lets take someone who started investing approximately  decades back  to be exact i created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you

a invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year

b was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year

c did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year

d just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest   

for analysis simplicity lets assume that you were on a conservative side never picked individual stocks and always made your investments to sp  for investment amount consider that you started with investing k in  and increased your investments by  for every subsequent year so you made a total investment of k over the last  years  

results



the analysis did throw up some interesting results theres a lot to unpack here and lets break it down by each segment

the most important insight is that its virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market  even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year you will still end up having a  return on your invested amount

at the opposite end of the spectrum if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year you would have made a cool  more than someone who invested only at the top given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases lets consider some more realistic scenarios      

if you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each monthyear you would still make a shade over  on your investments

out of all the above scenarios you would have made the most amount of money a whopping  return if you invested only during major crashes in this type of investing you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash

while this seems like a good idea in theory its extremely difficult to execute properly in real life the main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are

a the current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes its very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening you can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up it can end up wiping out your portfolio

b identifying a crash itself is very hard



as we can see from the above chart the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year so even when the market is down  it becomes extremely difficult to know whether its going into a deeper crash or whether its going to bounce back up

conclusion

while the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returnswise practically its very difficult to execute it

for eg even if you predicted the  coronavirus crash correctly where would be your entry point the market was down  by mar th another  by mar th and then another  by march th for a total of  if you did not get in at the absolute bottom you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous runup   

it is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns adding to this in the last  years  of the best days in the market happened within  days of the worst ones  if you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested

if you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom you will make an absolute killing in the market for the rest of us continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice

for example in my class i found a loophole in the way the teacher was simulating bonds and resource management students started with random resources random widgets to build that required resources they might not have and cash you could also trade sim stocks or sim bonds i realized that the rate of return on the bonds was enough to beat any of the other investments or revenue from selling widgets in just one week bonds matured daily and i could reinvest total proceeds daily so the magic of compounding so i went to every student that needed the resources i had and swapped them for cash then yolod all that cash into bonds i won by a huge margin with almost zero risk and producing zero widgets gdp was zero just like a hedge fund","put it all on slightly otm weeklies on whatever volatile stock you want the goal of this exercise is to increase variance even if the teacher doesnt realize it

for example if you can bet it all on an even odds coin flip you approach winning the game half the time in a class of  thats fantastic as other smart people realize this is the game you have to put in all on worse odds with a higher payout the more people in the competition the higher variance you want","we had the same except we waited for a month i x my money ngl i was pretty proud

the overall hypothesis is that mars influences human behavior in a very negative way not just on investors but people in general i have been demonstrating how that same marslunar node alignment also affects military conflict there is a near identical planetary alignment between mars and the lunar node during the significant terror attacks and stock market crashes

the book the mars hypothesis by anthony of boston uses this thesis to present the idea that the federal reserve can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet mars in this book data going back to  shows that as of april  percentagewise the dow jones rose  when mars was within  degrees of the lunar node since  the dow rose  when mars was not within  degrees of the lunar node the dow rose  mars retrograde phases during the time mars was within  degrees of the lunar node was not counted in that data as mars being within  degrees of the lunar node the purpose of the book is to not only hypothesize that the federal reserve can set interest rates based on the movements of the planet mars but to also demonstrate exactly how and at the same time formulate a system that would enable the federal reserve to carry out its application in real time using the observation of the planet mars the book contains a strategy for controlling inflation interest rate setting recommendations and the predicted dates of future bear market time periods all the way thru the year",1,nan,nan,nan
Stock market,options,Can Wallstreetbets beat the market? - I analyzed 20MM+ comments made on WSB in 2021 to see if you should pay attention to their stock picks. Here are the results.,"like chan found a bloomberg terminal

this is how wallstreetbets define their community for those who dont know  is one of the biggest stock market communities in the world having more than mm members its where millions are made and lost every day on outrageous bets and the only place where losses are celebrated as much as the wins

whether its for the insane yolos posted every day or breaking robinghood with infinite leverage plays or the legendary shortsqueeze involving Gamestop Corporation (GME) wallstreetbets is where the action goes down  sums up the absolute chaos that rwallstreetbets is

but what we are interested in is to see if we can beat the market by using the stock picks made on wallstreetbets after all





data

reddits praw api and pushshift api were used to obtain the data for this analysis there were more than  million comments and posts made on wsb in  i have had a vm running for collecting the live data from all the financial subreddits since dec

the summary sheet containing the analysis will be shared at the end in a google sheet but if you want access to the full historical data you can get it from 



analysis

ahh this is where it gets tricky there are multiple ways to consider what constitutes a recommendation from wsb since there are millions of comments its not realistic to invest in each and every recommendation made on the subreddit

so what i have done to simplify this is to calculate the most popular tickers for each day  why i settled on this logic is because a stock from this list is what a person is most likely to see when heshe would randomly browse through the subreddit and the higher the number of mentions the more the chances of investing in the said stock

considering the practical limitations i kept the cutoff at the top  stocks once we have found the top  discussed stocks of that day we invest in them at the market close then we calculate the returns generated by the stocks over the next

a one week

b one month

c till date  from the date of investment to today

the benchmark for comparison is spy we will compare the returns against spy to see if the most popular recommendations generated by the platform can beat returns by spy during the same time period 



results

before we jump into the returns here is a visualization of how the most popular stocks have changed over the last year in wsb



 in case the visualization is not loading  



we would have made a grand total of  investments  in  following this strategy we would have lost money on more than  over the next week and more than  over the next month but if you consider till date we are slightly above  if you compare this to spy its an extremely poor performance as during the same period spy would have given a positive return of  over one week  over one month and  till date as spy is trading at an alltime high now

but the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately  out of the  stocks you pick even if you get  wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high which is what wsb is aiming for  its definitely not for safe plays

so how has the average performance of wsb picks fared



would you look at that wsb recommendations have hands down beaten spy across all time periods it gave a  overperformance over the period of one week and  over one month and a whopping  if you had held on to your stocks

but keep in mind that your performance is skewed towards a few stocks which got featured repeatedly in the top  list



Gamestop Corporation (GME) has been in the top discussed stocks in  of the days and on average you would have gained  if you invested in it every day both amc and tsla are close followers with both of them giving substantial returns among the other ones who have made the list repeatedly only bb clov and wish on average have lost money 

now that our main question is out of the way we can really do a deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns



unsurprisingly gamestop and amc are at the top of the pile with Gamestop Corporation (GME) returning an insane  in one week even if you remove Gamestop Corporation (GME) and amc due to the unlikely scenario of a shortsqueeze the other  stocks would have doubled your investment in one week 



for every winner there are bound to be losers if you bought into Gamestop Corporation (GME) at the top of the rally you would have lost  of your investment in the next week all the other companies on the list had a brief jump in popularity but folks who invested in that ended up holding the bag

but what if you did not want to invest in  stocks every day what if you only wanted to invest in the top stock of the day ie the one creating the most discussion would you have beaten the market



unsurprisingly you would have beaten the market by a wide margin this is mainly due to the insane returns generated by Gamestop Corporation (GME) amc tsla etc which came to the top of the list you are just being rewarded for the high amount of risks you are taking by putting all your investment into a few stocks  



limitations

there are some limitations to this analysis which you should be aware of

 as explained in footnote there are  days of missing data  though this is not going to affect the results in any significant way as its lesser than  of the total days in the analysis
 this analysis does not consider options which is a big part of what wsb is made of the returns from options can be wildly different from what we are observing in the case of buying stocks
 we have just considered the last year of data where it was predominantly a bull market and meme stocks have made insane rallies the results might be different if we expand our time horizon
 finally the above analysis only considers the chatter and not the sentiment about the stock i would invest no matter if people are saying positive or negative things about the company my hypothesis is that we would be able to generate more alpha if we can distinguish the sentiment in comments a part of this analysis incorporating sentiment is in the works  stay tuned 



conclusion

before starting the analysis i fully expected to end it with

the real returns were the friends we made and the fun we had along the way

i was expecting that the chatter in wsb would be a lagging follower of the stock price rally and the people who invest in them would end up holding the bag

but i was pleasantly surprised to see that on average the stock that made it to the trending list beat spy in returns that too across different time periods

either its due to the selffulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause the stock to rally even more or it might just be that wsb is the place where we can successfully leverage the 

whatever the case may be you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to a stock that rallies  in one week only to drop  in value next week and then finish net positive by the end of the year for that you are rewarded with marketbeating returns

 during the Gamestop Corporation (GME) rally in january the traffic was so high that the vm failed i have used pushshift to fill in the details wherever possible but keep in mind that there are  days of missing data from th jan to th feb and  days of missing data in april nd week

 to find the most popular tickers i used a base of around  stock tickers that i got from IDEX Corporation (IEX) cloud the program would flag if any of these tickers were present in a comment or post this is by far the most dataintensive exercise i have done if you hypothetically consider the loop as a cross join we processed more than  billion rows to find the most popular tickers

 if spy was in the top  tickers we would invest in that as well i feel that this would slightly reduce our risk profile

 its lesser than the expected  investments as there are some days in between where we had data loss footnote  and also some stocks got delisted or underwent mergers eg aphira due to which we could not get the financial data from yahoo finance

Trading strategy,options,My most profitable options trading strategy: 0DTE Breakeven Iron Condors,"in april i started trading the DTE Energy Company (DTE) breakeven iron condor strategy this has so far been my profitable strategy

since a new year has started i have summed up my results from this strategy after  trading days and  individual trades

using an average buying power of up to    dollars i have made  dollars on this strategy during these nine months  for me that is a fantastic return at least compared to other strategies i have tried it is also less stressful than other DTE Energy Company (DTE) strategies as you rarely experience days with big losses

here is the essence of the strategy

i sell iron condors on spx with the delta on the shorts between  and  the distance to the longs are from  to  points on spx  i try to collect the same premium on both sides

immediately afterward i enter stop losses for each side for just a little more than the total premium collected for the iron condor  since usually only the stop loss on one side is hit this means that the losses are kept at a minimum hence the name breakeven

the tight stop loss of course leads to more losses of my  trades   have been losers and   have been winners but since the average winner is  times larger than the average loser the strategy has a positive expectancy

there are of course risks  the biggest being double stop losses that happened in   of my trades so far another risk as with any DTE Energy Company (DTE) strategy is bad stop loss fills

from my perspective the most positive with the strategy is that losses are kept so small but to achieve this stop losses are an absolute must

if you are interested in learning more i have done a detailed writeup of how i trade DTE Energy Company (DTE) breakeven iron condors on my web page",670,DTE Energy Company (DTE) gang wins and wins glad youre finding success with it,"if you search for  DTE Energy Company (DTE) tammy chambless you will find a youtube video and links to a presentation she does that goes into a great deal of detail on strike selection and stop loss selection  it includes some backtesting showing which have the greatest expected value

edit corrected spelling of last name","this strategy is the definition of picking up pennies in front of the steamroller stop losses are crucial

i ran this for a long time with an extremely high win rate but all it took was one crazy close that pumped like  points to wipe out months of gains"
Trading strategy,options,Painfully simple trading strategies that you had success with,"whats the simplest trading strategy you used that in hindsight was either really dumb or just lucky that worked for any prolonged period of time 

mine was jumping on the ripper  mins out of the gate on any of the faang or big tech names during the spring last year somehow this worked for like  straight months at a pretty decent rate and i grew my account by almost  id check futures see if we were up or down going into the open look at how the foreign markets closed out look at the big names and see if anything had gapped and hone in on the largest overnight movers in that tech or large cap sphere using robinhood charts and really zero technical analysis aside from a pretty elementary understand of candlesticks id read just half of the first m candle and if it pushed hard which everything does right at open i would jump in at the cheapest otm contract that fit my normal position size would normally get a continuation up until like  a slight pull back then continue up until the real reversal sometime around  id usually punch out right at the first sign of reversal around  which meant the first long wick candle i saw id bail out ended up leaving a lot of meat on the bone on multiple occasions and id check back around noon to see the contract up like another  but the goal was to lock in profit in a short time and get back to the day job 

kind of comical how well it worked and how much beginners luck it was but then again expectations were basically zero so the whole mental side of it never got in the way kind of fascinating to think about that too and how my own ignorance was a blessing to that style iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) tried to go back and do it a few times seeing if i can reignite that but i honestly get in my own way with it i now know too much or think i do which i clearly do not and either get spooked in one way or just get overwhelmed with all the different info and make the wrong choice 

either way would love to hear some other stupidly simple strategies that worked at some point",836,"buy super cheap way otm microsoft options like  days out wait until the price went up then drop them i was averaging  a month when i first started with options with that

then i discovered debit spreads and it all went to hell",sell covered calls theta gang sends their regards,"heres one that i had similar success with i still use it sometimes i would find a stock that was hot with day traders at the moment i would wait untill friday near close most day traders dont hold over the weekend i would buy the stock then sell again monday around  when they were peaking again this is a stock strategy not an options strategy  but its simple purely market mechanics no technical no E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) buy friday sell monday
edit dont let the cat out of the bag though guys or well have to start buying monday and selling friday"
Trading strategy,options,This has been my most profitable 0DTE options trading strategy,"for  months the DTE Energy Company (DTE) breakeven iron condor has been my most profitable options strategy in fact only one month january  ended with a loss

many have asked how the strategy did in the turbulent first half of  so i decided to do a new writeup you find the article here 

the strategy is quite simple i sell iron condors on spx at    delta at different times of the day  i set separate stop losses on each of the two spreads equal to the total premium of the ic typically i add  dollars on top of that usually i let the iron condors expire but i will also sometimes close them early to lock in some profit 

this is a very tight stop loss compared to what most people do and yes it will lead to more losses yet the strategy as such has proven profitable

here is the summary after trading this strategy from april  until today

 i have done  trades usually i do  trades per day
 the win rate has been   and the loss rate   this has stayed very consistent during this period
 all trades are with one contract only  and i will never commit more than  usd in buying power which means that i will have a maximum of  trades on simultaneously but usually less
 i have made  dollars on the strategy so far for the oneyear period of august  to july  i made  which is   of my max buying power committed to the strategy
 the average win  dollars is  times as high as the average loss  dollars  hence the positive expectancy despite most trades being losses
 the biggest risk to the strategy is double stop losses this has happened in   of my trades this percentage has stayed quite consistent as well during the whole period

this is not the only DTE Energy Company (DTE) strategy i do on spx but i like that i rarely have days with big losses it fits my trading style and risk willingness 

hope you find it interesting",419,i was shocked at the low win rate and high profit i guess i dont understand how you are managing the stops what i thought you meant is each wing stops at the full credit of the entire ic plus  so if max expiration profit of the ic is  you stop either wing at a loss of  or less which means the most the surviving wing can make is  do you count that as a win or a loss i dont see how such a strategy produces those average gainloss numbers with that win rate so i must be misunderstanding something,what platform are you using,there are many people using spyspx options as warranty against a big market swing then on the other side are traders who have statistically slight profit for selling such warranty to these people but they have to develop and polish a strategy minimizing a risk of total wipeout in case of black swan event where even automatic stop loss orders would fail
Trading strategy,options,Most leveraged option trading strategy for a strategy,"hi folks

i have developed a long strategy with  win rate the strategy is aimed for being a profitloss in  weeksthe price traget is like  usd above from current price

exif spot price of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is usd my strategy predicts with  accuracy if price of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) will reach  usd over the next  weeks timeframe

the challenge with this strategy is that we dont know when NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)  would reach that price target in the  week timeframe ie NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) could reach Portugal Telecom SGPS, S.A . (PT) hypothetically tomorrow or may be at the end of second weeki havent found a single strategy that could cover both these scenarios ex short dated options provide maximum leverage if say NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) reached the price traget in  day  but a calendar spread  weeks could give good return if say the price reached the target in  weeksi am not considering butterfly as it only gains value around option expiry and around the short strike levels

my question is  could there be any strategy that could give like  return for price target  being reached in a short time frame or price target being reached in a little longer time ex weeks

nbi have already played around with optionstrat and still could not find anything solid

editi may not have been clear when i say return i mean return on riskthis is different from return on my opening cost

editthe reason for  return is to have a positive expectancy for the strategytjeoretivally even a  return would give me  return on averagehowever i need to aim higher to account for  market turmoils that could break all strategies

thanks in advance",1,yes its called long at the moment calls dont overthink it if you have  odds then bet according to kelly criterion and remember to post your loss porn,if anyone knows that strategy then that person is multi billionaire or even first individual trillionaire i am guessing that person wont tell that secret to open public either if they know,and when this inevitably stops working and it will youll be back to scratching your head on what to do
Trading strategy,options,Options trading strategy,"im new to options trading so please forgive me if im being a dumbass and missing something obvious but why would the following strategy not work

before something is released that could either make or break a company eg quarterly earnings set up a straddle which i believe profits if the stock goes to either extremes and be guaranteed a profit since you know that the stock will definitely move by a large margin when this information is released",4,"guaranteed profit since you know the stock will definitely  move by a large margin

you either have inside information and if you trade on it you are committing a crime or you are just pure speculating

no such thing as a guaranteed profit","assuming youre talking long straddles here how do you know that the stock will guaranteed move by a large margin what do you do if it moves massively in after hours and then at morning open its neutral 

also volatility has expanded greatly before earnings volatility has a huge impact on options prices after earnings volatility usually collapses which tanks down the options prices",until you get iv crushed you should paper trade strategies first youll see firsthand why this wont usually work although it may have for tsla and Intel Corporation (INTC) but that is because they may have moved further than expected
Trading strategy,options,Summary of Carter's Trading Strategy From TastyTrade Rising Star Interview,"greetings traders

Tommy Hilfiger Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA) Inc (TOM) sosnoff of tastytrade  a young trader named carter in a live stream from thu  dec  if you dont want to watch the interview heres a summary of his strategy

trader

carter dobbelmann a yearold from san jose ca

claim to fame

turned  into  within  years

affiliations

 hes on hourglass trader google it
 he has replied to comments on the tastytrade video

strategy selling volatility

 exclusively trades options
 roughly follows what tastytrade recommends
 initially gambled with Swiss Exchange (SIX) significantly otm long calls on tsla to go from  to  without knowing anything about the stock market options or trading and getting extremely lucky then gambled  on Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) calls and blew away  to drop down to  after learning a more reasonable way of trading he looks for highiv underlyings and

 shorts puts for a credit
 shorts call spreads for a credit and
 shorts put spreads for a credit

 because he sells high volatility hes always looking at iv rank

tactics

 trades with the trend of the underlying using vertical spreads
 runs short call spreads when a stock breaks down and short puts spreads when it rallies
 if he sees evidence that an active play is reversing hell add the opposite spread type from what he initially did if he shorted a call spread hed short a put spread or if he shorted a put spread hed short a call spread

trade parameters

 sets otm striking prices going a little above or below the expected move based on   and ta
 uses DTE Energy Company (DTE)    days usually not more than  days on individual companies
 uses DTE Energy Company (DTE)    on spx

underlyings

 is indifferent to the underlying
 says he plays indexes eg spx
 initially he traded clov and amc
 he recently played si and Gamestop Corporation (GME)

trading activity

 he places  to  trades per day
 he maintains a portfolio of fifteen concurrent positions with many different underlyings
 with a  account hes likely risking  on each position

profittaking

 he exits whenever he captures  to  of the maximum theoretical profit usually closer to the latter
 because he uses distributed expirations eg DTE Energy Company (DTE)     days he takes profits virtually every day

risk management

 if he ran a short call spread and the underlying kept moving up hed roll the spread up and widen the striking prices
 this implies that if he ran a short put spread and the underlying keeps moving down hed roll the spread down and widen the striking prices
 he doesnt hold beyond the point of capturing  of the maximal theoretical profit to try to minimize risk
 he manages risk very actively and aggressively

unknown or unanswered questions

 how he builds a watchlist
 what times of day he typically entersexits trades
 quantity of each trade type
 scaling strategy
 underlying selection criteria
 DTE Energy Company (DTE) criteria
 triggers to roll a trade
 triggers to exit a trade
 spread width
 average number of distinct underlyings in his portfolio
 win rate
 average profit per trade

my thoughts

this gives us an outline of what hes doing but the devil is in the details and a lot is missing without knowing what iv rank threshold and other criteria hes using for scanning for underlyings the spread width what decisionmaking criteria he uses to trigger a roll etc we just dont have enough information to be able to try to replicate this

we also dont know anything about how hes making decisions about where the market is likely to go overall trading during the week of mon  dec  might be dangerous because more macroeconomic data is being released on tue  dec the cpi will be released the following day the fed will announce its interest rate decision at  pm E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ET) followed half an hour later by the jpows press conference it would be imprudent to try to trade oblivious to these important macroeconomic catalysts

this interview is interesting but ultimately leaves us guessing without additional information and a comprehensive list of trades over a threemonth period so that we could look at the transaction times and replay the price action to understand the decisionmaking i think that its impossible to truly figure out what a trader is doing and whether it could have a sustainable edge what would help the most is an excel spreadsheet containing every trades transaction time action and a justification for that action its impossible to reverseengineer what weve heard in just the interview well enough to put it to the test

we can reduce the unknowns by just focusing on spx if someone can track carter down it would be interesting to get him to fill in the blanks we really need to understand how he minimizes losses from positions that go against him to manage risk aggressively what triggers him to roll a position and how soon in the life cycle of a trade thats in trouble does he do this

artem",200,time will tell a few months is not a very long history sample size,"thanks for the excellent summary

if there are any newbies reading this threat and licking their lips and hoping for similar returns pls be very careful 

i sense that for every  carter then must be  others who tried the same strategy but blew their account but we never hear of them

carter basically sold credit spreads and given his  return in  years hes obviously taking a ton of risk on each trade

going forward he may find his returns are not so good cos his account is now larger and his emotions will change when hes playing with much larger amounts on the line its easier to double  than it is to double k","bullshit story nobody turned  into  from selling volatility 

the story would have been believable if the kid had  and turned it into more from selling optionsbut this story is so absurd that it can be dismissed outright

the only people turning  into tens of thousands of dollars are degenerates like me who buy short dated options and ride gamma and vega to valhalla

i sell options too but selling options is the classic takes money to make money story and its slow and steady selling options will never deliver outsized gains

great summary breakdown i just hate bullshit artists with bullshit stories especially when they arent even believable to anyone except the most gullible or inexperienced

take tastytrade with a heaping amount of salt too they do stuff like this to sell their tastyworks platform and options selling is for everyone narrative"
Trading strategy,options,Ultimate Guide to Selling Options Profitably PART 12 - Monetizing the Level of Implied Volatility (Big Brain Trading Strategy),"iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) found huge edges by trading how the level of implied volatility changes this post explains how 

 example i sold some of the january straddles on rivn when they released options this week at around  iv its now at  



i was able to capture  vegas in  day

this could have gone the other way but a lot of work went into pricing the fair value of iv here actually have it much lower than where it is now and in this lesson i will go into how to think about trading implied volatility levels and price it out for yourself

 most traders only think about trading implied volatility vs realized volatility

or what we might refer to as theta gang strategies but there is a whole world of opportunity out there to be explored by trading how the actual implied volatility number changes for options

 this post will go in depth on how to trade the level of implied volatility and how the pnl for it works

the reason i bring this up is that i have spent some time looking into mispriced options in longer dated options and i think there is lots of edge to be found there but in order to take advantage of this we need to understand how to price and trade the level of implied volatility

note these are advanced trades theres good returns to be made but it can be absolutely brutal if you are on the wrong side having a strong thesis and good position management are a must

 its all about that vega baby

trading is all about finding where you disagree with the market and then expressing your view on that disagreement correctly

if we are going to be trading the level of implied volatility we need to make sure we are exposed to change in the level of implied volatility

options off the bat are sensitive to this through one of the greeks called vega vega is the change in the option price for a  point change in implied volatility

for example if implied volatility went from  to  vega tells us how that would impact the price of the option we are looking at if our vega was  the position would change in value by 

 what options are most sensitive to vega

the primary way to get a lot of vega exposure is to go further out in time

when go very far out in time you have very little gamma and therefore very little theta the primary exposure is vega which creates a somewhat linear trade

 for example here is the greeks for a jan  straddle on spy

xb



as you can see we have very little sensitivity  to delta gamma theta but an unbelievably bigger sensitivity to vega this is why we consider these to be linear trades for the most part the pnl really moves up or down with changes in implied volatility 

what about nearer dated options  lets take a look at a straddle on spy that expires this week 

xb



when we reduce the time to expiration vega is much less impactful as you can see when we are expiring soon gamma and theta run the show primarily

in either situation if implied volatility goes up you are going to make your vega  if implied volatility goes down you are going to lose your vega  so when trying to monetize implied volatility dislocations looking further out in time is a good idea

 a slightly gruesome analogy to understand vega vs theta trading

imagine a person who finds out that they have  day to live they are going to expire in one day what happens in that one day before expiry means a lot to them if they have a bad day it would be devastating and good day would be euphoric

it makes sense they need to maximize on today the outcome of this day is definitive of the quality of their life

now imagine another person who has  years left to live

all of a sudden what happens today isnt such a big deal theres lots of days left so if today was mediocre its not the end of the world so what does this person focus on whats really important to how they feel and the trajectory of their life its their outlook on their future and what they see for down the road

 just like the person with  day to live shorter dated options are really sensitive to things that happen today a lot of theta a lot of gamma

on further dated options just like the person with  years left to live its more so the outlook on the future that matters if your option expires in  years its ok for the most part if the stock moves above its average daily move today  but if all of a sudden the future of the business goes from stable to uncertain the value of your options will change drastically the reason it will change drastically is because theres lots of vega or exposure to a change implied volatility

there is money to be made where the level of implied volatility is different than what we think it should be

 is there money to be made trading the longer dated options

a lot of people think you cant make a lot of money trading longer dated options so people will maybe buy leaps and sell covered calls against them since the leap is not very sensitive to volatility but as i hope you are starting to see this can not be further from the truth

for example lets take a look at a trade that was shared with me on arkx

when it became optionable this year a friend of mine shared some research on the longer dated options that was really interesting the  year options were trading at  implied volatility and our conclusion was that they were worth  implied volatility  over the next couple months it came all the way down a  point drop in implied volatility

xb



so the question is how profitable was the trade

here is what the position looked like at inception take a look at our greeks as you can see

xb



heres what it looked like at the end

xb



 the options basically got cut in half

because of the nature of this trade and the confidence in the research myself and the others i know in this position were able to scale up pretty big 

xb



 what was really interesting is how wrong the markets pricing was

as we go further out in time there tends to be less liquidity on some of these names when you go further out theres just less eyes on it that means opportunity

for example on rivn myself and the others i was looking at this trade with basically made up all of the longer dated volume early on tuesday 

because of how poorly it was being priced and the thoroughness of the research we did i was able to scale up on this position significantly iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) found that theres actually a lot of opportunity like arkx that comes around so now lets discuss a couple of basic ways to price these out and find these opportunities

 idea generation

something that iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) noticed is when realized volatility spikes in the near term sometimes the whole term structure will elevate and the back can get really out of line

so i typically look for these types of trades when bad news has come out around a stock industry or sector

examples of times that i have traded this way

 when archegos blew up longer dated vols on the companies that were held by the fund stayed elevated post event
 arkx release options were pretty illiquid and very poorly priced anticipating a lot more volatility than it should have given the underlying stocks
 tsla longer dated options were being priced at extremely high levels given the size of the company and relative to correlated assets
 kweb pricing in extremely high volatility higher than covid because of chinese market issues
 rivn starting to release options and pricing them at insane levels of implied volatility

 how to price the level of implied volatility Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) example

in order to explain how to go about pricing the level of implied volatility i am going to go through a trade that i took earlier this year on Discovery Holding Co (DISCA)

keep in mind that this is the sentence we are trying to complete the market is showing me that the stock is trading at an implied volatility of x i think the level of implied vol should be y

 the situation

earlier this year when the archegos fund blew up the stocks that it was holding took a massive hit simply put they got crushed this lead to a massive opportunity that was missed by much of the retail community the options market went berserk 

before the fund blew up the fair value for options were around  iv 

but when everything exploded the crazy movement in the short term caused the whole option chain to lift up all of a sudden the  day and  day options were trading at  iv

for perspective iv was at  during covid for the same DTE Energy Company (DTE)

basically things look really crazy so i set out to price the options and try to uncover a trade

 there are two ways to price the options here absolute value and relative value lets go over each way for Discovery Holding Co (DISCA)

  example of absolute value pricing

absolute value pricing involves comparing what we are seeing today for a stock against what we have seen in the past 

Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) july options were trading at  iv before the archegos liquidation as the event happened implied volatility shot up to  a couple days later when the event was over it was still at  iv 

xb



thinking about how options are priced it would make sense that the level of implied volatility came down here since the impact from the event had happened already assuming there were no further chain reactions and therefore the level of implied vol should come back down to what it was preevent or 

the reason i didt think there would be chain reactions is that the realized volatility basically stopped after the event check this out

xb



 with a normal implied volatility of  the event over and rv returning to normal it seemed reasonable to expect the iv to come back down to the  range

  example of relative value pricing

relative value pricing is an extremely powerful way to price options it involves comparing the options for a stock we are interested in against other stocks that are correlated 

for example ko and pep are strongly correlated they have similar levels of implied volatility take a look at this pic

xb



the above picture is showing  blue  pep  day iv green  ko  day iv bottom green  ratio between ko and pep  day iv

as you can see they move together when ko vol goes up so does pep

looking at the ratio you can see they have an average ratio between them that they mean revert around this is because they have correlated movements and implied volatilities when the spread between them gets too large we see it close 

now imagine we saw this

xb



the red line is a hypothetical situation where the ratio between them shot up

in this situation we could also say that there is an opportunity to trade the level of implied volatility for these companies

we could buy vol on the lower iv one sell vol on the higher one or we could look for which leg is inefficient and likely to change the most and just trade that one

 so how did i use relative value pricing to trade Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) 

first i went out to find a correlated stock the one i settled on was foxa then i plotted the ivs for each of them and looked at the ratio 

xb



as you can see at the time of the disaster the iv went through the roof since foxa was not a part of the disaster it was clear that it wasnt really an industry impacting event and that when the disaster is over the volatility should return to something back in line with this correlation 

 with an average ratio of about  and foxa trading at around  iv it seemed reasonable that we should see Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) volatility come back to around    iv

my analysis on Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) painted a very clear picture of what should happen to the options after the event because i had done enough leg work to develop a good thesis i was able to pack on some size and make a fantastic return 

 both my absolute value and relative value narrowed down on a similar fair value for implied volatility on Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) between  and 

from here i went and sold july straddles on Discovery Holding Co (DISCA) and sure enough the iv came down to my expected fair value and i was able to pay for a nice vacation  

i closed out this position when it was pretty much at my fair value 

on the flip side if this trade had gone against me i would have to go back to the drawing board and really dig into my thesis holding these types of positions through iv spikes can be catastrophic if you are wrong so a lot of work would have to go into why its moving against me 

on a couple other positions it has moved against me in the short term but then i have been right in the end of the day weathering those storms is no joke though especially if you have a meaningful amount of money on the line this is why i always stress the importance of knowing your stuff before scaling up your trades

 conclusion

by knowing how to price the level of implied volatility you can develop really strong ideas that can yield great returns this has been one of my primary strategies this year especially with the meme stock craze tensions in china etc 

 important point

this is not about just selling high iv a lot of the times iv is high for a reason this is about pricing iv and selling when it is expensive

a lot of traders make the mistake of selling because its high but i hope this post helps you think different about volatility and gives you some ideas about where you can find a real edge in the market 

remember once you have an idea of where iv should be you can make a trade if its different than what the market is pricing

Trading strategy,options,ULTIMATE Guide to Selling Options Profitably PART 4 (Finding a Edge and Building a Trading Strategy),"in this post i go into detail on  what a trading edge looks like  how to build a strategy  an example of executing a strategy 

this post is a bit trickier than some of the others i have made and will make in the future but dont let that discourage you 

trading is a competition in the end of the day it attracts very smart people to play and theres no free lunch ill be around to answer questions so please ask if you have any

previous parts of this series     read these and it will hopefully lay some groundwork for this post

 it all starts with idea generation

this is where i find a lot of people struggle but it should actually be one of the easiest parts of strategy development 

for you to have a profitable system you just need to be better than the next guy it doesnt need to be super fancy or complicated 

think about it like you are an electrician in your local town currently theres some guy making all the money for fixes in the area if you can find some sort of advantage now youll be the guy making all the money maybe you can get jobs done faster maybe you sell better maybe your price is lower 

note an idea alone is worthless just like in business ideas dont make money execution is what makes money 

note your idea cant be too general it cant just be i want to sell options it needs to be more specific with that being said it doesnt need to be something super complex 

at this point we are just deciding on something we want to investigate 

examples of good things to explore

 is the implied variance risk premium higher on etfs than stocks
 where is the variance risk premium the highest across us equities
 is selling vol on tech stocks and buying vol on finance a good pairs trade
 can we forecast earnings straddle pnls

 a trading edge has distinct characteristics

below is a list of different things that can lead to an edge in the market i share these to spark some ideas so that you can think about where you should look for an edge given your unique situation

xb

 data access do you have access to better data that no one else does example imagine the number of species in the marianas trench could predict tomorrows spy price well no one has that data so if you did you would have more knowledge than everyone else and youd make the most money 
 skillsets if you are competing in a very low capacity space where there is lots of individuals and not so many teams having strong data science skills pull in data manipulate and transform the data  could give you an edge and help you build your trading business 
 your network do you have access to people who can give you good ideas example private equity deals  having a network of professional traders to collab with etc 
 specialization if you are a corporate lawyer can you figure out ma deals better than the next guy if you work in small cap tech can you figure out software development cycles and product release dates better than the next guy are you a doctor who understands biotech better than the next guy
 geography you can only trade certain products when you live in certain places this also incorporates regulatory issues too 
 being first to an idea i guess this is the reinventing the wheel point this is a pretty competitive route to take but for example when new products are released no body really knows how to price it efficiently so there is room for you to come in and take a stab at pricing it better than the next guy 
 liquidity constraints using your capital size to your advantage warren buffett once said if he had a million dollars he could do  a year and that is because he could take the same ideas he uses and use them on lower cap stocks which are less efficiently priced so where can we go that the big players cant dont try to find food in the ocean find a pond with lots of small fish 
 high barrier to entry due to infrastructure we cant really just go and start a high frequency trading firm the infrastructure for this is insane so if you have it you could have an edge 
 risk tolerance do we have a higher risk tolerance than the next guy and can therefore take trades  with more pnl variance that others maybe avoid cant take example a volatility hedge fund might not want to deploy a strategy with  daily swings even if the expected value is huge 

those are some characteristics of a good edge idea and hopefully it gives you some ideas 

in another post i will go into my strategy for earnings trading as a follow up example to this the reason i am exploring earnings is because there is a lot of retail interest its tricky to model well and theres likely to be a variance risk premium 

 building your strategy

  pick what you are trying to predictforecast 

something really important to note is that whenever you are placing a trade it is your opinion vs the market there is somebody on the other side of your trade taking on the opposite view of you 

since we are trading our ideas against the market it means we are expressing a disagreement with the markets view on things so whether we know it or not we have some sort of forecast or predicting on how things should be priced being conscious about what we are trying to predict is very important 

for example if we are trading earnings volatility what we might be trying to predict is the straddle pnl and if we can identify when they are cheapexpensive we can build a strategy 

what we are trying to predict is referred to as your target variable 

 not why but whether

once we have an idea or something we want to forecast we dont want to ask why does this exist we start by asking whether this exists 

so many retail traders fall into this trap they say this sounds like a good idea because of a b and c reasons im going to trade it 

but we cant ask why it exists until we confirm whether it does 

this part usually requires some pretty serious data science skills a workaround for retail is to look at academic papers for ideas or surround yourself with people who have the skills 

a good place to research is 

 what should we try to predict

what we try to predict is important heres an example to illustrate 

its hard to predict the score between west ham and manchester united  an ok team and an allstar team but its not so difficult to predict who the winner is likely to be 

so for our trading sometimes we dont need to be trying to forecast the exact move we can start by just focusing on the bias

so from a basic perspective if we are trying to forecast whether a stock has an inflated risk premium in its options they are expensive we can look at some data points that help us predict cheapexpensive a fair value on volatility and a reason for it but then in our execution we can be less married to our fair value target price and trade the cheapexpensive bias more consistently 

  determine the factors that help us with our prediction

imagine you are trying to predict the amount of horsepower that a car has in your model the target variable would be horsepower but what can help us predict horsepower

 whether the car is a v or v
 the colour of the car
 rear front or all wheel drive
 number of doors

lets say we determine that the  points above are good indicators of a cars horsepower these would then become our predictor variables 

you can think of predictor variables as the checklist of things we go over when trying to make a conclusion about our target variable 

example if a car has a v engine red paint rear wheel drive and  doors its probably over Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP) 

 consulting the data

if you want to be able to do this on a professional level you will need to develop your data science skills being able to work with and manipulate data is the equivalent of knowing how to type in the professional space its not an edge but its basically expected that you know it 

in the retail space most of us here its a nice to have and not a need to have so yes knowing it can be an advantage but its not a necessity 

i will focus on how to do this with no coding background unless enough traders want to see the other part 

 an example of trading a strategy being implemented

note a lot of you ask what tools i use a lot of the base data points and scans that i rely on are from predicting alpha i then use think or swim to stress and analyze positions i execute trades in interactive brokers 

the reason i use these platforms is they a provide me with analytics tools that ease the burden of needing data science skills b let me analyze my positions in depth before putting them on c offer me the best commissions and execution on my trades

for this strategy i am sharing in this example i am trading the difference between the implied and realized volatilities for us equities because of the variance risk premium and increased retail interest i aim to build out a model that helps me identify overpriced options

 lets start by defining my target and predictor variables

 target variable realized volatility over the next  days for a stock

 predictor variables current realized volatility last  days current implied volatility  day current future forecast of volatility  day current ivdrvd spread

through my own research and things iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) learned the set of predictor variables i listed above are good at telling me about what realized volatility will look like over next  days

for each of those factors i am trying to determine if they are high or low relative to the historic metrics except for the volatility forecast which is something a bit different basically a statistical forecast of the future 

beyond each of these factors i will look at the news to add a more qualitative component to my analysis i want to understand why i am seeing what i do 

  start with a scan

i started by running a scan for a stock that had some liquidity and an iv  forecast by at least x i also added a filter for iv to get rid of stocks that werent implying much to happen

the reason i do this is that the market has way too many things to look at and its efficient to use a scanner to filter from s of equities down to a shortlist of things that meet a base criteria for your strategy 



xb

by doing so i generated a list of  stocks to look at given the time of year most of these stocks have earnings around  days from now so i had to be careful to avoid ones with big earnings moves priced in since i am really trying to trade the non event volatility most of these stocks have a bit of earnings vol priced in on the DTE Energy Company (DTE) options

the stock i chose for this analysis is grpn groupon 

  evaluate your predictor variables

iv rv and forecast  analysis

iv  

rv  

fv  

iv is over x fv this is my expensive indicator for the fv predictor variable

off the bat this is looking good iv much higher than rv and forecast this is usually a strong sign for sell options

to move on lets plot the historic iv and rv to see how they are moving relative to each other 



if we plot the historic iv and rv we can see that for the last while there has been a consistent premium of iv over rv this is my expensive indicator for iv and rv

one cause for concern we can see that iv has continued to rise despite the lower realized volatility which means that someone is still a buyer at these levels and could be a slight cause for concern i would definitely want to do somme digging into the company to see whats happening around it and try to hypothesize about who could be buying here 

one last point we will look at here is if this ratio between iv and rv is normal or if its at an extreme 

as i described in a previous  think of iv and rv as being in a dance together they take turns leading the dance but they try to stay in step with each other

so looking at how they move together we usually see it mean reverts around a comfortable spread between the two if one strays too far from the other they move closer together if they move too close together they push further apart

 here is the iv  rv ratio for grpn over the last year



as we can see the ivrv spread is towards the top of the range meaning they are far apart right now so we can expect either rv to pick up or iv to come down or them to meet in the middle theres other combinations of possibilities but lets keep it simple

if we look back at the first graph we see that rv has remained the same while iv has been moving up so i could conclude that perhaps it will meet somewhere in the middle iv comes down a bit rv goes up a bit but below the current iv line this is my expensive indicator for ivrv ratio predictor variable

 if we look at all the variables they check the boxes for the realized volatility to be lower than the implied aka iv is expensive 

now as mentioned theres some qualitative research into the news sentiment whos trading this to really build some qualitative confidence too but assuming that checks out i would be selling options here

 from here i would put on a trade that properly express my view that volatility is expensive maybe a straddle 

i will go more in depth on structuring and managing trades in a later post its a whole topic on its own

 these are the basics of good strategy development and finding an edge in trading 

i hope that this post has given you some ideas and insights into the world of profitable trading it might seem like over kill but i promise that i do not go out of my way to to make things complicated we actually want things to be as simple as can be while still being profitable 

an important thing to note is that you can actually do all of this work and still lose money trading its a tough game we need to always be improving looking for new ideas always on the hunt for that better edge 

 if you found this post valuable please upvote it as that gives me ideas about what i should write about in my next post

now some of this probably falls under network as you mentioned since i certainly leverage the opinions of my peers in tech when making some of these decisions  however trading companies in an industry that you intimately understand is definitely an edge and has served me well for a very long time  sure there are big firms out there that will do their E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) and have quants with decades of experience to actually do it but even then the quants are going to ask people like me about a companys products and i can guarantee that one of their quants wouldnt be able to look at ddog and have their eyes light up during their demo because they can finally give me a solution that iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) wished i had for the previous  years  i realize that im also glossing over things like revenue and how a company is run overall here and in reality i can still take those things into account to a certain extent  its not too hard to look at a smaller tech company and determine if theyre going to crash and burn because they cant run a company  i cant tell if theyll succeed in general but i can definitely tell if they wont based on how they run their dev process this seems like it would be difficult to determine but in reality iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) found that i can usually make a pretty good guess and iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) never been wrong before so i think that along with the usefulness of their offerings is enough to make a pretty good case in terms of fundamentals"

Options trading,options,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,"i want to preface this post by saying that i personally only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks with that being said i have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis if you already have a bit of experience with options this post may not be very beneficial to you because im just going to cover the basics of options how they work and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them

first and foremost what are options options are actually options when you buy an option contract you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a predetermined price up to a prespecified date if you decide to do this you are then exercising your options

there are two types of options that you can trade which are call options and put options call options or just calls allow the holder to buy at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock because of this your call options price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises put options or just puts allow the holder to sell at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to shortselling the underlying stock because of this your put options price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines because one single option contract represent  shares of the underlying stock you would have  shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised

 

now the predetermined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contracts is known as the strike price when buying options you have to choose a strike price along with an expiration date which is the last day that your options can be exercised both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy because they greatly affect how the options will trade before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options its important to know a bit more general options information

as for strike prices there are really two main kinds in the money itm and out of the money otm itm and otm refer to the underlying stocks price in relation to the strike price of the contract calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered itm whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered otm on the other side of the spectrum since you want the stocks price to go down when you own puts your put options would be itm if the strike price is above the current stock price and otm if the strike price is below the current stock price

 

i know its a bit confusing if youre new to options to give an example if stock xyz was trading at  a call option with a strike price of  would be itm since the underlying stock is already above the strike price however since calls and puts are essentially opposite a put with a strike price of  would be an otm put in this scenario

whether an option is itm or otm has a big impact on how to option will trade the main reason for this is because all otm options are worthless at expiration this means that if you invested  by buying one call option at   x  your contract would be worth  if it was otm at the markets close on the expiration date and you would lose your full  investment because of this otm options are generally higher risk higher reward than itm options although itm wont be worthless at expiration like otm options they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay

time decay in options causes the price of the contracts also known as the premium to decrease as it gets closer to expiration this alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay so in order to profit from options you have to not only be right about the stocks direction but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay

time decay along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts are represented by what are known as greeks the greeks are theta vega delta and gamma like i said the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so im not going to go into a ton of detail on the greeks in this post but i do at least want to explain theta theta is the greek representing time decay in options you can see an options theta along with the other greeks before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay generally the theta will be higher for otm options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at  similarly theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches

theta makes general trading rules like dont fight the trend even more important for example if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support so in this situation youd be correct about the stock finding the bottom but you would still lose money if it didnt start to bounce back up quickly if you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options youd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support

 

although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades there is actually a way to have it work in your favor you can short options contracts which is also called writing just like with shorting stocks you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short in my opinion this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling

the reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts you would lose money as the options increase in price its the same reason that many people are afraid to shortsell stocks but options are generally more volatile which creates even more risk even though i wouldnt necessarily recommend it for beginners i wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post

regardless of how you trade options its important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced like any other type of trading you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options especially if youre trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time

maybe after this youll see why i stick to trading stocks rather than options they can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders but theyre much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns

hope this was helpful let me know what ya think",1357,i understand all this the thing i dont understand is how to not lose all my money,i started trading options this year  and let me tell ya you can be right with calling the direction of the stock and still lose money on your call or put,"step deposit money
step make decent profit on first trade
step proceed to lose every penny because of faux confidence based on step

Options trading,options,3 Step Process To Options Trading,"i have been trading options for over  years and i am frequently asked where can i learn to trade options here is my  step process most of you are already mastering the first two steps and if you are proficient at those the options part is pretty easy

all of your trading has to start with market analysis that means getting your bearings from a technical perspective moving averages volume trendlines momentum and also be aware of the fundamental backdrop earnings interest rates economic data political policies i spend  hours each morning conducting market analysis this is the most critical step and it is the biggest piece of the puzzle more than  of all stocks follow the market if you get this wrong there is a  likelihood you will lose money i always have a  minute chart of the spy up when i am trading and i never take my eye off of it once you have your market bearings you are ready for the next step

lets say that you have concluded that the market is bullish for the next few days and that the uptrend should continue there are not any speedbumps economic events ahead and the downside risk is minimal now it is time to zero in on the best stock

i look for stocks that are moving higher when the market is moving lower i call this relative strength Reliance Steel & Aluminum Company (RS) do not confuse this with the rsi indicator that compares the stocks current move to its recent price movement i find little value in rsi find stocks with relative strength that are moving higher on heavy volume and that have broken through technical resistance these will be your best prospects

if you get the market right and the stock right options are easy they are simply a way for you to increase your leverage heres the rub i am not saying that getting the first two steps is easy it is very difficult and until you hone your skills with steps one and steps two you should not trade options you will simply lose your money faster

basic options buying strategies and vertical spreads are all you need to trade any market scenario your opinion of the market and your confidence in that forecast determine the best options trading strategy along with your opinion of the magnitude and the duration of the expected stock move keep your strategies basic and the positions will be much easier to manage

options are not the starting point they are the icing on the cake market first stock second and options last

i went through the entire process and it culminated with a trade example here is a link to part

Options trading,options,Stop falsifying information when applying for options trading.,"this has very clearly become a huge trend of applying for things people dont understand and its about as intelligent as the blonde applying for a credit card and then not understanding they have to pay it back 

and for fucks sake it shouldnt even need to be said but if youre so mentally fragile that you start to feel suicidal after making the trade you didnt understand but that youtuber you like said was a sure thing you shouldnt have been trading in the first place 

educate yourself and youll be able to consistently pull a profit instead of trying to strike it rich understand that you wont pull a ten thousand percent profit every time and that is perfectly okay for you to take your profits before your investment has reached peak value understand that youre not losing by taking  gains if it continues to increase in value afterwards and understand that you lying to your broker just to be able to take more risks only hurts you

some people will most likely think this post is mean or too harsh but the stock market is a harsh mistress and i dont believe that we are doing anyone any good by coddling them and that it only makes the overall problem worse for the record i think brokers current system regarding applying for things like options trading and such is completely broken and actually exchanges these people to lie but the ultimate responsibility still lies with the investor",929,why yes i am a recent college grad  years old and i have  years experience trading iron condors gets approved for level,merrill lynch requires lvl  for buying calls my  years Eagle Materials Inc (EXP) got me lvl,tastyworks pretty much gives anyone the ability to trade options and their sister company tastytrade provides a ton of education on how to trade options if anyone wants educational resources tastytrade is a good place to start and then if you like them you can join their brokerage no lying necessary

thanks in advance",60,"every gimme has a gotcha 


you can try to learn about the greeks and how they work   but at the end of the day the options greeks come out of the options price they dont determine the options price the market buyers and sellers is what ultimately determines the price black scholes is just a model that describes how the price of options should be based on normal distribution  remember its just a fancy model that is used to help describe the physics of how an options price moves the mode is a good predictor but it isnt the rule of law 



if youre going to go down the path of greeks learn delta theta gamma and vega there are more greeks but those  will cover what you need to know 


delta  you can think of this as the chance that the stock will end at that price its also the amount the  options value will move based on a  move in the stock so say you buy a  call on a stock thats  and it has a  delta and the stock moves to  expect yourself to gain  cents not  on your call option   note closer to expiration the delta starts to collapse meaning a  delta is a lot closer to the stock price at DTE Energy Company (DTE) than at  DTE Energy Company (DTE) 

gamma its a derivative on delta it says how much delta changes with a  move in the stock so did the example above of the delta was  and the gamma was  then a  move would make the delta now change to    note closer to expiration gamma starts to grow exponentially

theta this is the time component of options the options will theoretically lose theta amount of value every day    as you get closer to expiration the theta on options starts to grow exponentially 

vega   kinda hard to explain this one but its essentially how the options price changes according to the volatility of the market for the stock   if vega is high youd have to look at iv rank or iv percentile to get a better picture of this then the options price will be high think Gamestop Corporation (GME) or amc when they were mooning the options vega would explode so the options prices would skyrocket 





now all that knowledge isnt going to help you trade my advice is sell puts on something like slv maybe  delta something like  days out and then  close the position at  days rinse and repeat   do that for a year and since slv is relatively safe you wont lose money but youll learn how options prices get impacted by price movements or by time if slv is too slow for you pick a stock thats under share but more than share and do the same thing","im not really interested in someone starting with k or more making money but the guysgals with small accounts

k is a small account in options terms

no guy that makes hundreds of thousands produces yt videos promoting his strategy for xyzmonth



i dont expect myself to make millions but just want some realistic expectations

you wont make millions 

newbies are sadly sold this dream by yt marketeers that options is a gateway to fast and easy riches dont believe the nonsense you see like i made  in two hours now i want to teach you how to do it
think of options trading like doing an engineering degree for  years at the end you are not an engineer but you have the basics of becoming one then it takes another  years of real world application before you become an engineer same with options

dont believe me try it with real money

 evaluation methods

in this paper three methods are used to evaluate the companys final fair value each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company the final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used

 growth rate

the growth rate of  is determined by the average analysts consensus for the companys next year growth rate

 free cash flow evaluation model

this simple model takes in mind the company last years available cash flow data its wacc based discount rate of  and its growth rate of  to determine a fair value of  per share

 adjusted graham fair value formula

this model is used in the value investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value this formula is created by benjamin graham a value investor and professor at columbia university who is considered the father of value investing this thesis uses the adjusted formula to better adjust it to the current market environment

data used for the calculation

datavalue

eps
growth rate
Asco Plc Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS) (AAA) bond yield

the adjusted graham intrinsic value formula gives us a price tag of 

 discounted cash flow model

this thesis uses free cash flow gained by subtraction capex from cash floe from operations free cash flow fcf is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures it is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firms value and to make companies more comparable

in simple words it is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt therefore has no interest payments to make

in this model it is taken in mind the following data

datavalue

wacc based discount rate
growth rate
average us gdp growth rate
average shares outstanding

which projected a fcf for the next five years as per follow

note the projection is based on the assumption the company will keep growing by a perpetual rate of  which is highly improbable due to unknown future events and variations in the market this shall be taken only as an indicative forecast

the calculation gives us a fair value of  per share

 weaknesses

 manufacturing complications tesla faces continuous launch manufacturing and production ramp delays while launching their new vehicles and other products for example tesla faced endless manufacturing challenges when they were about to launch model x which lead to constant delays for distribution similarly the company went through extreme troubles while manufacturing model xs battery module assembly line at gigafactory 
 unable to meet demand might affect brand value due to highly experimenting and complicated procedures tesla might face an unbalanced supply and demand unable to meet the production ramp
 lack of high volume production it has failed to produce high volumes of automobiles for any of its models even now as the company plans to manufacture model  vehicles at high volume it faces issues in terms of production cost and management resources
 shortage of batteries the shortage directly affectes the sales of electric vehicles and energy storage systems
 elon musk as teslas sole representative musk is deeply involved in other projects and side quests
 financial uncertainty tesla has outstanding debt of  billion if the company is unable to generate enough cash flow to repay its debt then there is a risk of delaying expansion reducing investments selling assets etc
 employee safety concerns tesla was recently fined in  for creating a tent production line without a permit or safety inspection also the company did not train workers about the risks of working in the tent for long periods under the scorching californias heat
 leadership wrangles friction and conflict between management and the board of directors can undermine productivity and longterm success teslas management and board have been engaged in several power struggles

 product defects teslas cars and other energy products have exhibited major flaws in many cases the defective products often have weaknesses in design manufacturing and other features which harm the companys image permanently
 long term confidence tesla due to its unstable manufacturing conditions suffers from disbelief among the public about its longterm existence which can result in a deficiency in further business development
 customer adaptation the company highly depends upon customers willingness to adopt electric vehicles
 disruption of supply due to shortage of materials tesla can face major suspensions in the supply of manufacturing materials due to the increased prices the company uses aluminum steel lithium nickel copper and cobalt as well as lithiumion cells from suppliers all these materials have volatile prices which can affect the companys production line severely in the future

staring at your portfolio like a sad puppy well have no fear because

Fundamental analysis,options,"$NVDA: Short-Term Bull Thesis Formulated Synergistically Using Perennially-Tested, Fundamental Trend-Analysis with Harmonic Analysis Based on Fibonacci Symmetry (""Sacred Geometry"")","welcome

in this analysis well illustrate and explain why we have become quite bullish NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) in the shortterm using perennial fundamental trend analysis  harmonics based on fibonacci symmetry analysis synergistically if you are reading this we assume you have already witnessed andor experienced the potentially powerful and remunerative effect of sound technical analysis hence if you have only studied classical trend analysis techniques with supportive volume flow analysis you are in for a treat because we potentiate the accuracy of these tools with harmonics

we will begin with the classical perenniallytested fundamental trend analysis NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has been trading within a channel with the upper railresistance extending from oct  and the lower railsupport from apr  as can be viewed in figure 

figure   

upon rejection from the top railresistance in sep  it entered into a bull flag formation after a false breakdown from this flag  a test of the multiyear channel support in early mar  it surged into a major rally  broke out of the flag midapr  next it was rejected from resistance extending from sep  above the bull flag causing it to retest the flags upper rail prior resistance as support which it did so successfully all of this can be viewed in figure  more clearly

figure  

henceforth the fundamental trend analysis has allowed us to understand its still in breakout region now lets thoroughly examine the shortterm harmonic setups which may act as technical catalysts to fuel the breakout

on the min chart our team has identified a bullish gartley harmonic which acts as the large frameworkwithin the trends contextof our shortterm bull thesis targets  invalidation level are on the chart seen in figure  also note that the volume flow is still positive on this time frame despite the recent selloff hence such divergence in volume flow supports the bull thesis 

figure  

on the min chart heiken ashi candles our team identified a bullish abcd harmonic which reinforces our shortterm bull thesis again targets  invalidation level are on the chart seen in figure  volume flow is also still largely positivebullish despite recent selloff

figure  

finally on the min chart heiken ashi candles our team identified a bullish deep crab harmonic which is why we believe it will show strength very early next week again targets  invalidation level are on the chart seen in figure  the volume flow is tilted towards reflecting selling which is expected on this extremely shortterm timeframe however the selling was not significant enough to be reflected on the previous min and min frames analyzed previously

figure  

therefore our shortterm bull thesis is frameworked by the trendanalysis ie trendanalysis demonstrates nvdas in breakout territory and reinforced with confluently bullish harmonic internals on multiple timeframesthe ideal golden setup for which outperforming traders exercise the most difficult element of trading patience


disclosure we do not currently hold any position in NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) however we will be looking to enter long early in the upcoming week ie mon morning if the price remains above the invalidation levels and below the initial targets this is educational material and should not be considered by the reader as financial advice one should be sure to perform ones own due diligence before entering or exiting any position in the equities markets

Fundamental analysis,options,I built a Reddit-powered “Bloomberg terminal” to track ticker trends and identify bull/bear cases,"xb



hey everyone i built a site that tracks all types of trends across reddit mentions comment volume bullish sentiment etc i know theres a couple other sites out there with similar functionalities so i wont go into this aspect too much list of features at bottom

another big inconvenience i wanted to address was finding good bullbear cases a lot of subreddits and posts end up being echo chambers where only one viewpoint bubbles to the top so its hard to get unbiased opinions also some of the best E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) can be found nested in the comments and those can be hard to weed out thats why i added the ability to filter for analysis in posts and comments by financial sentiment bullbear to help you find opinions from both sides of the spectrum the term analysis encompasses things like E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) companyfundamental analysis news etc this tool can be found on the ticker view page under the analysis screener tab

heres a brief list of features

 reddit post feed filterable by ticker subreddit and flair
 analysis bias screener allowing you to sort analysis E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) company analysis news etc

 price action filtering page allowing you to discover tickers based on price changes combined with trend data for example if you wanted to see which tickers dropped  in price over a week that are above a certain popularity threshold

note that financial sentiment may not be as accurate for nonanalysis posts as its harder to pinpoint a positivenegative viewpoint for less researchbased posts also posts that have bullish and bearish sentiment may be classified incorrectly obviously the model doesnt perform perfectly

Fundamental analysis,options,Technical or Fundamental?,do you guys believe the technical or fundamental analysis is more important when swinging an options trade i just want to see as i dont have a preference but want community input,6,"my mentor taught me that the longer the trade is the more fundamentals analysis matter if its a very short term like day trade fundamentals dont matter if you are in a trade for a year like leap or even  months or so this is when fundamentals matter a little more than technicals 

now you can mess up on a leap trade if your entry which is technicals is off like buying at the top new ceilinginstead of waiting for a bottom  new support so long term i definitely look at fundamentals more but technicals matter a bit short term i look at technicals more fundamental  matter a bit less",supplydemand zones are pretty helpful in swinging unless theres something more fundamental that comes along to drive the price a certain direction nothing is ever a for sure thing but when it comes to ta the more indicators you have the better obviously,why do i have to chose one i use both

Technical analysis,options,we hear a lot about Technical analysis being bogus but are price action strategies proven to work?,"you go online and hear many people talk bad about technical analysis often times these experts compare it to astrology they thinks its all pseudoscience why is it that they think this

a couple years ago i was told about a research done that should price action strategiestrading is actually the only proven type of technical analysis i cant seem to find it maybe you can help me with it with quantitative analysis how retail traders like us use it to help make successful trades",58,"ta is a big tent some of it is really voodoo out there like lunar cycle analysis but the core of ta is just statistics and math nothing mystical or astrological about a simple moving average used appropriately statistics and math can give you ballpark estimates of direction and momentum can it guarantee that a trend line will continue long enough to make a profit no can it guarantee that a resistance line will hold no

a good way to get perspective on ta is that ta is always about looking in the rearview mirror it can only tell you what happened in the past it cant tell you what will happen in the future you could be driving up to a pot of gold or slamming into the rear of an  wheeler ta wont tell you either way

ta is a toolbox and unskilled and stupid people can misuse any tool and make ridiculous claims that give the whole toolbox a bad name like all you need to build a house is a hammer does that really mean that every tool in the box is bogus no

probably the most useful guidance i can give you is that with trading you can either set a profit or loss goal or a time goal you cant set both so if you want to make a  profit you can definitely achieve that goal i just cant tell you when that might happen if you want to run a trade for  days you can do that i just cant tell you how much you will gain or lose after  days

so to trade price action you need to control the range of one or both dimensions this is why day trading is mostly about price action because it focuses mainly on very modest profitloss targets over very short amounts of time so the uncertainty of the free variable moves within usually tight constraints in other words its a way to control for uncertainty",we hear a lot of people holding bags talk about ta being bogus ta is the study of price action i dont understand the question laugh out loud,if ta is good enough for druckenmiller paul tudor jones walter deemer and most pros out there i dont rlly care if PP&L Corporation (PPL) on rstocks call it astrology

Technical analysis,options,CONTROVERSIAL OPINION: Technical Analysis is unnecessary.,"every week i see people get wrecked placing trades based on ta  which is why i am fully convinced ta is unnecessary at best and dangerous at worst   trying to predict what the market is going to do based on past pricing is a fools errand  no one can consistently predict shortterm direction

to back me up on this heres warren buffett

ampgtlet me be clear about on one point i cant predict the shortterm movements of the stock market i havent the faintest idea as to whether stocks will be higher or lower a month or a year from now

and now let me be clear im not sayin ta doesnt work at all  maybe it does to some degree who knows   im saying even if it does whats the point of spending time on it when the findings are already priced in

to put it succinctly my argument is that the most current and relevant information you need to make a trade decision is contained within

 options pricing  probability
 implied volatility  iv rank 


options pricing  probability

a bunch of smart well educated people who are paid a lot of money to conduct real due diligence and gather real data like how many shipping containers left china on monday are placing huge bets on where the stock is headed in the future  and its all reflected in option pricing  probability  

and as i mentioned above even if ta is useful those same smart people are already using it and have already priced in their findings  so in my humble opinion taking time to learn how to draw lines on a chart isnt an efficient use of time since the conclusions drawn from those lines are already reflected in the option price  probability of the trade



implied volatility   iv rank 

the real edge is in using implied volatility  i do believe that iv reverts to the mean over time so if iv is high you can expect it to eventually go lower and visa versa  this means if youre an option buyer look for low iv  iv rank   buy at low prices and if youre an option seller look for high iv  iv rank  sell high at high prices   and to all my option sellers its been shown that  so if youre looking for an additional edge there it is

for more on the subject  explaining why iv is the most important factor when determining which underlying to trade

too long; didn't read  stop drawing lines and let the paid professionals who are are highly trained experienced and have access to the best data do the bulk of the work for you  from what iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen investing is one of the few endeavors in life where the average person can make above average returns by doing less  

strong opinion loosely held  open to hearing what others have to say on the subject",64,"if everything was priced in the stock would gap to the level it should be valued at based on the experts opinion and sit there thats not how trading works people buy and sell ta in its very basic form is the analysis of supply and demand trends

every successful trader i know uses some form of ta even if they dont call it that or use it with other metrics even if you dont use it it wouldnt hurt to learn it so you know what the idiots are trying to chase that day so you can do the opposite then again selling to the crowd to help create resistance would technically be technical analysis",in options maybe but is an essential tool when trading futures you can make a killing if you find yourself on the right side of es,"ta is a broad umbrella ill agree that pattern charting is bs but youre not doing yourself any favors if youre ignorant of what beta or momentum is

one final point im not sure of anything better than using moving averages to avoid value traps value and momentum is a great combo with lots of research to back it up

the only other way id use ta is in a minimum variance not to be confused with low volatility strategy but thats equities not options"

the consensus is that some of the more esoteric types of ta like  or using  is batshit crazy but that is not all of ta thats just the fringe plenty of people use sma and macd ta to trade options including financial professionals",i trade with ta how do you set your direction without understanding a growth or a demise,hopium

Technical analysis,options,"Strategy: Cut your loses, or trust your technical analysis and ride out until expiry date?","hi friends

i am fairly new to option trading so i kindly ask you wait to tear me apart until i become at least a little more experienced  then you can go crazy i had bought some call options for september that i believe will rise and i set them aside theyre down now but since its a longterm play i am not worried  but in the mean time i decided to practice my technical analysis and complete some shorter option plays the past week i had completed enough research and analysis that i was confident on one position just so you can follow along as a reference  spy put options at a  strike so when price had dropped yesterday as i predicted you could probably guess that i had an inflated sense of getting the hang of it as you might know today it is not headed towards what target price i think it should drop to and rather up towards record highs

this is where my title question comes in at what point do you decide to cut your losses about  here right now but recoup some money or to play it out towards expiry just hoping that what everything you have read and analyzed will be correct i still have confidence in my research and believe that tomorrow could be a very red day in response to a new resistance level but then again i do not want to be foolish would losing all the money break me no but it will still hurt at the very least

thank you very much for helping me on my journey

Risk management,options,Rules of Risk Management,"given the current environment and with the past two days wiping out many new traders i feel that it is appropriate to post my rules of risk management which have been requested by others on previous posts

as a former fund manager and traderinvestor with two decades of experience under my belt here are the rules i have developed for myself concerning the trading of options

 never invest with money that you cannot afford to lose this is the cardinal rule of risk management

 limit your overall exposure in any single position this includes multiple directional positions on the same underlying to a maximum percentage of your portfolio that does not exceed  for larger accounts k and  for smaller accounts k and below

 always analyze the direction of implied volatility prior to entering a trade only look at debit strategies when iv percentile is low and only look at credit generating strategies when iv percentile is high in situations where you decide to take a directional trade bullish or bearish the use of spreads is recommended when iv is elevated as this will negate much of the risk associated with both vega volatility decay and theta time decay

 longer time horizons are advisable in selecting expiration dates for debit positions and the use of shorter duration credit spreads can significantly reduce your risk thus elevating your probability of profit

 where liquidity is concerned  only trade options that are highly liquid meaning that they have high open interest and thus tighter bid and ask spreads which will significantly lower the slippage on each trade you take

 asymmetry of risk  only enter debit positions that offer  or more units of potential reward for every unit of risk this means that if youre risking  on a trade your potential return should be at least  for credit positions this is not feasible thus the tradeoff becomes taking in a credit with an exceptionally high probability of profit which provides a positive expected value on the trade for those of you unfamiliar with the term expected value  theres this thing called google

 maintaining a cash position of greater than  of your portfolio value is always advisable i personally maintain  cash at all times you never know when a position is going to go against you or when an exceptional tradeinvestment opportunity will arise thus you want to be in a position of optionality with respect to taking a new favourable position or adjusting an existing one

 scale into your positions by laddering your orders this is especially important for those with larger account sizes since you can attain much better average prices on your positions by buying incrementally or selling credit positions incrementally for example if you have  to allocate to a single position assuming a portfolio value in excess of k you can allocate  in  separate orders or  in  separate orders conversely when selling your positions you should always scale out which will allow you to ride your winners much longer than you normally would by incrementally taking risk off the table which detaches you emotionally from your trade

 manage your emotions and avoid fear of missing out option trading is a strategic game that should be done with much care patience and discipline by managing your emotions and working strategically as a trader you will develop a pattern of decisionmaking which is integral to your profitability and success over a long time horizon fear of missing out is a terrible thing because it causes you to chase trades that have already passed you by focus on your trades not what everyone else is doing

 put aside money for taxes and live within your means assuming you follow the above rules and have a solid fundamental understanding of how options and the financial markets work you should see profits in the long run which means that you need to be disciplined in squirrelling away money for tax purposes so that jpow and his band of merry morons can continue giving it away to those of you who are living off of everyone else read up on the tax laws where you reside and if youre generating enough profits hire a proper accountant to take care of your taxes for you

bonus rule document all of your trades in a trade journal  if you dm me id be happy to send you a copy of the excel template i use



godspeed and if youre serious about making your money work for you longterm instead of working for your money longterm memorize these rules and apply them or dont and continue chasing tendies like the majority of undisciplined individuals iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) come across while repeatedly saying would you like fries with that

the choice is yours

too long; didn't read  spy p for  this is a joke of course",493,"thanks a lot for this post im mostly already follow these rules but or at least trying to i sometimes make mistakes

Risk management,options,Options Risk Management,"does anyone have an options risk management strategy that really works meaning it provides consistent profitability for swing trading of long calls and puts and long and short vertical spreads 

the prevailing wisdom which i would characterize as swinging for the fences of starting to take profits at a  gain while leaving runners if holding multiple contracts on long naked options and debit spreads or alternatively when the short strike is hit for the latter stopping out at a  loss and a  gain loss on credit spreads leads to too low a success rate for me and too many painful reversals and drawdowns  i know it should also depend on support and resistance levels but assume those arent hit or broken before the profit target or stop is hit

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen some traders start taking profits on long naked options at as little as a  profit while setting stops at breaks of intraday support or resistance meaning their rtr isnt quantified which doesnt make sense to me on the other hand if they were to set stops at say a  loss that would result in being stopped out of too many trades and could only work for daytrading as overnight gaps could result in losses much bigger than 

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) also seen someone a popular guru who runs a trading alert device who claims a high success rate and consistent profitability from a credit spread strategy strictly bull put spreads to wit that starts taking profits at as little as  though im not sure how he sets his targets",4,"if you want consistent profitability go with high grade bonds andor companies with either proven dividend track records or high quality preferred stocks

Risk management,options,Lesson From This Week's Volatility - Risk Management,"the markets handed a tough lesson this week to many options traders some may never return most  will be licking their wounds for weeks or months and a very few will take this as an opportunity to trade the carnage the lesson to learn is not about your trading strategy or indicators but risk management

i have worked as a market strategist for the past  years alongside a few thousand retail and institutional investors in foreign currency futures equities and options a common experience amongst selfdirected investors is a repetitive string of small winners followed by a few big losses that wipe out weeks or months of gains this is because the common theme with successful traders isnt their strategy or which indicators they use but rather their process for risk management

there is no shortage of empirical evidence and studies examining how humans skew our view on risk and reward research shows that accepting a loss is viewed to be twice as painful compared to the same amount of gain this leads to the behavior of hanging onto losers far too long and closing winners far too soon 

the reality of investing is that there will be losing trades and one must first accept this as a fact in my experience it is the pursuit of preventing small losses that ironically triggers some of the largest losses we may have all experienced having a small loss adding to the position with the hope of getting back to breakeven only to have the position decline even further into a larger loss unfortunately some investors will compound this habit resulting in a total account blowup or loss this begs the question how do we trick our brain into turning this around

to help with this quirk of human nature professionals turn to a rulesbased approach first there needs to be a decoupling of the concept of winning trades from being profitable while the two are correlated they are not bound together most investors that struggle make the incorrect assumption that if they just win more often they will be profitable however evidence shows that it is far more likely that a few big losses are typically what pushes accounts into the negative to this point the primary focus of investors is not to prevent losses in the first place but only to prevent large losses this can be achieved through discipline with the help of trading tools such as stop loss orders option strategies with limited risk and never risking more than  of your account per trade moreover it is best to never add risk to a losing position

trading is an infinite game not a finite game yet  of traders still try to win every trade there is no such thing as winning in trading when you focus on the wrong goal thats when you spin your wheels and get nowhere  if you dont understand this do a quick google search on finite vs infinite game

take this lesson into next week if youre in a losing position on fridays close and hoping to get yourself back to breakeven next week think twice if its worth blowing up the rest of your account for it or do you take a loss and regroup",440,"please repost this in  point billboard size font for importance and so that everyone reads it and then reads it again i started to copypaste excerpts to emphasize in this reply but i ended up copying the entire original poster laugh out loud

still these two really standout as the too long; didn't read

 a common experience amongst selfdirected investors is a repetitive string of small winners followed by a few big losses that wipe out weeks or months of gains this is because the common theme with successful traders isnt their strategy or which indicators they use but rather their process for risk management
 

and

 trading is an infinite game not a finite game yet  of traders still try to win every trade","knowing and understanding the logic of both sides institutional and retail trading actually is a finite game for the retail investor its the same solution here as it was to the  however the problem lies in three major mindsets

 few people have real targets they believe they need to make it to millions or more when in fact most people can live comfortably their normal lives off of significantly less
 they just enter bad trades most of the trading losses here are from fear of missing out they have no rules as you stated but without a goal they also have no incentives to quit which leads to poor trading it was no secret that tesla was overvalued and the market was overheating it was obvious the smart people left that nonsense alone
 there is an end the goal of trading for the retail investor is specifically to quit trading i say this to people they vomit thinking its madness however if people traded like the goal was to quit trading they would trade better its like working any other job all your life where the goal is to eventually earn enough to retire which has many definitions but is easily understood to be universal financial freedom and stop working for money

the lesson to be learned here is that for retail you are not an institutional investor the lessons logic and rationality behind institutional investing do not apply to you

sadly this will be overlooked again and the cycle of carnage will continue",thanks for this posti have a sheet of paper taped on my wall with these sort of tips which i frequently update so it doesnt just become a fixtureit has definitely helped keep my impatience and gambling tendencies at bay
Risk management,options,Selling Options Risk Managment,"hey

first sorry for my english

so i was wondering what kind of risk management you guys use when selling options or rather which one i should use because all of them arent really optimal in my mind

i want to sell options on futures with a delta of  and DTE Energy Company (DTE) of 

here a all the risk managment strategys i know

 use a  stop so if the option doubles in price  you just buy it back maually
 spreads or other fancy option combinations
 buy the option back when the underlying broke a chart pattern trend support
 dont do anything
 roll the option 
 strangle if it goes against you or other strategies for repairing

xb

 

i have some problems with what they teach in a lot of books

because they say if you sell an option and as long as the price is abovebelow the srike you make money but then they also recommend to use a  stop so when the option doubled in price you buy it back to limit risk but if you do that you have to time the market because essentially the first day is the most important and the second one the second most importat and so on 

real example i sold a bull put spread at delta  DTE Energy Company (DTE)  and the next day the market was down like  and my position was  so if the third day was also going down i would have been stoppt out even though my stike was waaay below the current price 

so the profit line isnt the straight stike line its a curve thats pretty close to the actual price in the beginnig and it slowly goes to the stike line because afer days a underlying move of  doesnt change a whole lot where a  move the first day could stop you out

xb



 i find the risk to reward ratio too slim to just spread and dont do anything else

i always want to spread but only in combination with antoher safety mechanism

xb



again timing is a problem because if your imaginary stop is at a support level like lets say  below the price of entry and its being reached in the first week of your DTE Energy Company (DTE) option youre going to loose a lot of money in comparison if the exact same happens days later you dont lose nearly as much or you could even be in profit

xb



stupid except cash secured or covered

xb



for me its doubling down if you dont want the underlying if you want the undelying its not doubling down because you just get it cheaper but if you dont want the underlying and you have a  stop in place you essantially double down sell option for  it doubles to  your stop triggers you roll and sell an option for  it doubles againg to  now and so onworst case

xb



didnt try it yet dont know if i like it

xb

xb",4,"all good questions we have some explainers about risk management in our wiki  that you can read

 i want to sell options on futures with a delta of  and DTE Energy Company (DTE) of 

puts or calls risk management is different depending on which type selling calls is generally riskier than selling puts since naked short calls have unlimited loss potential

too long; didn't read  overall one of the most effective risk management techniques is right sizing dont size up more than your risk tolerance can take trade small so that you can be indifferent to a  loss or even ten  losses in a row

 use a  stop so if the option doubles in price you just buy it back maually  so the profit line isnt the straight stike line its a curve thats pretty close to the actual price in the beginnig and it slowly goes to the stike line because afer days a underlying move of  doesnt change a whole lot where a  move the first day could stop you out

that is more of a problem with the  being too tight than the technique itself and it only seems wrong because the position recovered what if it didnt what if it lost  the first day and then another  the second day and then another  the third day etc youre going to regret not having that  stop out on day one

if you want to say it is hard to pick a good stop limit level in the face of volatility over time i agree with that but being hard doesnt mean you shouldnt do it

 spreads or other fancy option combinations

not all spreads only definedrisk spreads they might just change the profitloss profile for example both a naked short call and a short straddle spread have unlimited loss potential

 buy the option back when the underlying broke a chart pattern trend support

more generally set a loss limit on the trade and close it if it reaches or passes that limit again this is just part of an overall exit strategy

 dont do anything

i suppose no decision is also a decision

 roll the option

rolling is a technique that is indifferent to whether it increases or decreases risk so i would not include it as part of risk management you can roll a profitable trade to maintain the same less than or greater than level of risk

 strangle if it goes against you or other strategies for repairing

yes there are various rescue strategies all of which seem of dubious value as risk management to me they often add more risk","i agree with the other reply that position size is the primary tool 

anything that depends on closing or rolling may fail catastrophically during fast markets this is when risk management matters most 

take the example of closing at  percent loss if the stock gaps the next tick might mean a  percent or worse loss 

trading halts changes in margin requirements are when most calm market techniques will fail game over for those that counted on orderly markets where rolling or closing at a reasonable price is taken for granted 

whatever a person decides have a plan for up down unchanged before getting in trade long enough and the worst case will happen 

someone asking basic questions is probably better off staying risk defined for a long while longer",close your eyes and jump
Risk management,options,High POP Isn’t Risk Management,"if we fail to planyou know how the saying goes i experienced my largest loss several years into my trading career i had be doing decent and had over  years in the market 

the trade was a very wide short iron condor in rut that was a very high probability trade there it was that was the plan 

as we can all see the series of glaring issues here a couple stand out specifically
i relied on probabilities to manage my risk this was pure ignorance 
i didnt size properly i was too focused on what i was trying to make vs how the trade would behave during its lifecycle 

i made this mistake once and it was the largest  drawdown iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) lost far more on a raw  basis on my account over the past  trading years sure the trade set me back but thats all relative anyways so that part didnt bother me the issue was i failed to understand these high pop trades simply defer the risk into the future where at some point if we continue the same strategy long enough will eventually be realized 

i now deploy  risk control measures 
 each trade has clearly defined risk protocols via sizing and mental stops 
 the portfolio has max drawdown thresholds diversification requirements utilization scales etc",26,"i relied on probabilities to manage my risk

i was too focused on what i was trying to make vs how the trade would behave during its lifecycle 

i congratulate you on the awareness to learn these  lessons even if it came from a painful experience  this is how we grow and improve as traders well done","not sure why probability is a positive under your risk management 

almost by definition higher probability of profit means lower rewardrisk ratio so it should be a negative as in you stand to lose more when you lose","lets take a deep breath  from the moment you invest money  you take on risk  in  the banks failed  taking peoples money with it  a bank  supposedly the safest place in the world  sam bankman dweeb just reintroduced risk yo a whole new trusting generation xyz welcome to the world 

you take on risk getting on a subway  getting in a car a plane  

an iron condor is a crappy trade as most spreads are  why their rate of failure is   the more elements there are to a trade  the higher the loss probability  also you are limiting your profit in return for premium  any pop higher than your wingspan denies maximum profit  

in a casino the best is red or black at the roulette table  if not for the green zeros it would be  the house lives on the small percentage of the green zero  in craps  has one additional probability over  the house lives on that 

but put and call is  you win or lose the question is  by how much earnings is risky  technicals and fundamentals can all be good guidance not good  goodbye money  

spreads  vertical  diagonal calendar are all limiting and really reduce your odds  vest you can do in a credit spread is keep premium  most times the best you do in a  point wingspan debit spread is  cost you  to set up maybe  and bring you back  meh 

scalping and momentum is bottom feeding penny anti slot machines 

if you do your homework and really dig in to whats moving an equity connected to an options albeit the pop on earnings  buying the reviews and selling the news in PartnerRe Ltd. (PRE) earnings  or waiting for the earnings to hit and playing the aftermath thats your choice you can win or lose in any strategy 

the most consistent earnings are cash covered puts and covered calls  you can life on premium alone  it the out dives  you got the stock cheap but not as cheap as waiting for the dive and buying covered calls premium  and assignment  i rolled  verizon calls for premium till it went down  then at  i did a cash covered put  bought it back at  and really  when my premium is factored in

Risk management,options,"Risk Management, or How to Not Lose Your House","too long; didn't read make smaller trades trade different stocks for diversification and make sure your portfolio isnt  dependent on either the market or volatility going in a particular direction

 introduction

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been seeing a lot of posts lately from people blowing up their accounts in one way or another and i would say most if not all of these happened because of a lack of risk management when youre trying to build an options portfolio there are strategies and rules you can implement to minimize the chances of half your portfolio evaporating

 money management and position sizing

there was a study in  where participants were given  and were asked to bet on coin clips for  minutes the coin was weighed so it would land on heads  of the time but the payout was  despite the obvious mathematical advantage  of the participants wiped out out of  participants  bet their entire bankroll in one go

position sizing is especially important when options trading yes you might have an edge but variance is always worse than you expect if you wouldnt bet your net worth on a coin toss why would you bet more than you can afford to lose on weeklies that expire worthless  of the time by keeping your individual position sizes small you reduce the risk of any single trade wiping you out check out the kelly criterion if you want to learn more about optimal betting sizes

personally i try to keep the risk of each position under  of my portfolio that doesnt necessarily mean that i can only spend  of my portfolio buying power on one trade but i might have a stop loss equal to a  loss of my overall portfolio

for example if you have a  account you can spend  on rkt weeklies if you want but if you follow the  rule you should have a stop loss and close the trade when your calls lose 

on top of that i wouldnt have more than  of my account at risk at any given time this way i can buy the dip when it happens or give my short positions a bit of extra margin if things go wrong options utilize leverage so you dont need to use every dollar of buying power available to you

 asset diversification

aside from keeping your account in multiple smaller positions you want to keep your holdings in different assets if you have a bunch of small positions but theyre all in memetech stocks youre probably not having a good month right about now spread out your trades across different sectors of stocks a portfolio with pltr rkt blnk Nuveen Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NIO) and tsla is going to be a lot risker than a portfolio with pltr Streettracks Gold Trust (GLD) spy ba and tlt im not saying dont trade the meme stocks but they shouldnt be  of your portfolio

good tickers to trade are liquid well known and generally not too correlated with each other an example watchlist could be Apple Computer, Inc. (AAPL) ba crsr spy iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund (IWM) qqq pltr Streettracks Gold Trust (GLD) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) and Morgan Stanley (MS) the broad market indexes spy iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund (IWM) and qqq are more correlated than most but you can use them to adjust your portfolio  iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund (IWM) is more small caps and qqq is good for tech exposure

 directional diversification

in addition to trading different stocks you might also want to trade in different directions stocks in different sectors might be less correlated but a broader market downturn could still hurt your portfolio you might want to have long deltas for some of your positions and short deltas on other stocks

maybe you think that the financial sector is going to outperform and tech is on a bit of a downwards trend maybe you want to be short tech for a while instead of just waiting to buy the dip im personally a net seller of options so i might sell put spread on Morgan Stanley (MS) and call spreads on Apple Computer, Inc. (AAPL) this way even when the broader market dips im okay since at least one of my trades will do really well

its good practice to look at the beta of your portfolio and see what your pnl looks like compared to moves in a benchmark of your choice your broker should be able to calculate how correlated individual stocks are to your benchmark and determine how your portfolio is affected by market conditions if your broker doesnt do that please get a better broker if youre playing on robinhood with a few hundred bucks fine but if youre trading seriously and have a profit goal instead of an entertainment budget please switch to something like tos or ibkr

for me ibkrs risk navigator lets me know that by next month ill make  on my overall theta gang portfolio as long as spy stays within   of where it is today of course i can boost my returns even more through managing my trades squeezing some more gains out of my winners and losing the minimum on trades that go wrong

 volatility diversification

ever hear of iv crush when you buy calls right before earnings your stock pops up  the next day and you still lose all your money thats implied volatility working against you similarly if youre only long vega and the market  the vix calms down its suddenly a lot harder for you to make money even directionally uncorrelated assets like spy and tlt have correlated volatility when the market tanks everybody rushes into bonds for safety while spy falls and tlt increases both have become more volatile for different reasons if youve only got iron condors on these two tickers you might be in trouble

have some positions that benefit from increased volatility and some that are the other way around if you only have short strangles and credit spreads maybe try some calendar spreads on stocks with lower volatility if you only have debit spreads maybe you might want to sell some iron condors on medhigh iv rank stocks",209,"there are also resources links frequent answers on risk reduction trade size and more at the

Risk management,options,Options selling and risk management,"update below    
in the past my options trading was very volatile with just buying calls and puts with no real strategy i made money and lost money by luck i have been studying options for few months now and finally landed on selling strategy

i have been selling spread options and iron condors for  months now and i have  success ratio i am not sure if this is luck or i have found the option trading style that works for me my positions carry around  risk so for  risk trade i keep  i am using few options tools which show me percentage of profitability based on blackscholesmerton model these positions are normally around  chance

i am sure this will not last long and i am afraid one big swing in market will erase all my profit of  months

i have positions in spy  Streettracks Gold Trust (GLD)  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)  cost for this month lets say each position i am carrying  risk so total  risk and i am making  if they all expire worthless

if the market drops like a hot potato then i may have to roll over my positions or take total loss

note that i dont have stop order loss due to nature of volatile market i like to keep a close eye on them

what do you guys suggest how should i improve on this process  thanks for any suggestions here to learn

xb

 update  

yup  luck ran out and blew up the account thanks to market melt up exactly this happened what i was afraid of good thing is lots of knowledge acquired to fill the gap my spy short call was assigned early and i did not get a chance to roll out i ended up exercising my long and short and took loss which basically puts me now at net zero ytd 

xb",3,"congrats by moving from buying to selling now consider moving from spreads and ics to selling puts on stocks you would not mind owning and then selling covered calls if assigned the shares

spreads and ics have costly long legs that reduce premiums profit slower and are hard to roll or manage  selling puts on high quality stocks will bring in more premium for the same delta profit faster and are easily rolled

most of  has been a cake walk with easy profits but this wont last and it will get harder  one of the best places to be in a drop is high quality stocks

see my wheel trading plan post that explains how it works","you are worried about blowing up your account i see if you are worried i would address the wheel  i never read scottishtraders style but i have a strong sense that holding some stock and holding some options is less leveraged and brings down your risk 

i would then allocate only  percent to spreads  and then  to buying callsputs  or hedging your portfolio 

spreads are the hardest to manage as if one thing goes wrong your back at one this is why i would learn dynamic spreads as that would help your risks 

for the second part of the wheelassignment part i would learn dynamic stock to bring your wheel roi higherstay in this allocation untill you feel comfortable to ramp up the risk part

Risk management,options,Risk management with small accounts?,hey so im new to this sub so sorry if it doesnt belong but iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been trading for a couple years now and the one thing i keep struggling with is risk management with smaller accounts im still profitable but it seems my  weeks of  gain a day gets knocked out by one unlucky trade any tips,3,"this is a great question

our usual riskmanagement suggestion is to not risk more than  of your account liquidation value in any one trade but if you only have  liquidation value that severely limits your ability to trade options since very few option trades only risk 

so there are two possibilities

 dont trade until you have enough cash where  provides you with sufficient choice of trades as hard as that may be to hear its usually the best advice

 expect to blow up your account and refill multiple times if you have a good source of earned income like a good paying job this might be an acceptable alternative youre basically borrowing against your future income

if you do not have a good source of earned income that you can borrow against youre only rational choice is to save up cash until you can trade with more risk","what are you doing have any stocks long options selling options spreads  or etc 

why are you getting knocked out by one trade how 
does one trade knock you out",no single trade should risk more then  to  percent of your bank good rule to follow to keep the grind grinding
Market trends,options,Rangebound vs Trending Markets - Stopping Theta Gang From Stealing Your Money,"i introduction

im sure every one has been robbed by theta gang once or twice whilst yoloing on FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS) there is nothing worst than death by a thousand cuts chopfest bringing your option to zero even though the stock hasnt moved this post is going to show you how to identify that before you enter a trade  and how to get around it altogether

markets only do two things they consolidate  or chop within a defined range gathering energy for the next move and they trend  or break a defined range moving in a straight line towards a new one this is the basis of most technical analysis and technical patterns

markets consolidate about  of the time and trend about  of the time  but most people only know how to trade the  this is why many fail  its important to understand both scenarios

 ii rangebound markets

this is when a market is chopping within a clearly defined range price will sell at the highs  and rise at the lows  constantly reverting to the mean the mean in this case is usually the center of the range price is chopping because it wants to see what buyers and sellers think of this range also key players are building new positions here

basically  you are going to see a lot of chop with no clear direction  and long options holders of both varieties will get brutally fucked iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund (IWM) is a great example its been rangebound for  months

 iii trending markets

this is when a market is moving in one direction  breaking into a new range price is ready to go subsequently buyers and sellers have finished adjusting their positions for the next move the amount of time we spent rangebound determines the length of the trending move the longer the better  and the wider the range the better

this is when you want to buy long options price will move perfectly for them to profit  and theta gang usually wont be an issue

 iv practical applications

 rangebound markets

in a market like this the best strategies are mean reversion strategies this means to buy the dip and sell the rip you generally want to stay away from short dated long options altogether and play with theta gang this means put credit spreads at the lows call credit spreads at the highs you could also use calendar spreads or any other theta positive play you want time and chop to be working for you not against you

first though  you need to identify the range you can do this through technical patterns  or key levels technical patterns are simply lines that define the range the price is consolidating  and when price is no longer consolidating they are your roadmap for avoiding the chop and playing the eventual breakout

put credits and call credits will work the best when price is near extremes and implied volatility is high calendar spreads will work best when implied volatility is low

lets take a look at an example to reinforce our understanding



if you read my previous post you know that iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund (IWM) is the small cap index  or the index everyones favorite meme stocks are in

look at what its been doing for  months its literally in the same spot all its done is chop back in forth in this defined range you can identify said range by drawing a line connecting the highs and the lows  and you will see it forms a symmetrical triangle this is a common technical pattern when coming from upside the end result is biased bullish  but in the mean time price is going to chop sideways fucking your options

in this situation you either want to buy the low of the triangle and sell the top  or you want to buy the breakout a daily close above or below this is massive pattern so the breakout will likely bring a massive move

 trending markets

here  you want to play on the momentum side this means playing options where volatility works in your favor like regular old calls puts  even straddlesstrangles you can get away with short dated options here if these are your primary method of making money  stay out of rangebound markets and only play trending ones you have to know when its time to sit out  cash is a position too

when the market is trending is when retail is printing and social media is ripe with meme stock gains  because the vast majority of retail only knows about momentum trading and doesnt know another way exists this is how big players like it so they can steal your money the other  of the time

heres an example of a trending market



price makes new all time highs every couple weeks ever since it broke that range that lasted from last september to last november until we break some of those trendlines down  you can expect it to continue  and you can ride the wave since its a bullish trend  in this market you want to buy the dip and look for smaller technical patterns to buy breakouts

however  for the best play on a trending market  you usually want to enter the moment the technical pattern that creates the trend breaks for instance when that iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund (IWM) triangle finally breaks this gives you the best risk reward since you can stop loss just below the breakout in this case you wanted to enter calls in november and buy the dip every drop since

Market trends,options,5 Tips For Exiting Trades,"most novice traders are taught to think about their exits in one dimension for instance the stop should be  lower and the target should be  higher this mechanical process does not account for other factors that are impacting the stock here are  things you should include in your exit strategy

 market conditions every trade needs to start and end with the market i always start with the daily chart to get a feel for the momentum in the chart below you would be more aggressive buying the bounces off of major moving averages these dips have been buying opportunities the last few years and once support is established we get a series of bullish trend days long green candles that means that you can let your trades run longer because you have a strong market trend working in your favor and the stock is likely to keep grinding higher when the market makes a new high you can see how the candles compress and the volume drops off this means you have little to no market tailwind and you need to set passive targets during the day you should be aware of key support and resistance levels across multiple time frames 

xb



 relative strength  is the stock maintaining its relative strength to the spy i compare the stock tickfortick with the spy if the spy is up then i want to see the stock move higher if the spy is flat i want to see the stock move higher if the spy is down i dont mind if the stock is down a little but it has to be holding the bid well if the stock maintains its relative strength you should stay in the trade as long as the market dip is not organized and as long as market support is intact if the stock starts to soften on a market dip it is a sign to take profits in the chart below you can see how the market was testing support dips and how well the stock held up during those periods this is a sign that you are on the right side of the trade and as soon as the market regains its footing the stock will shoot higher

xb



 heavy volume  volume tells you that the current move is gaining traction if the stock is rising on heavy volume you want to ride that move longer than a stock that has normal volume during a rally you also want to see declining volume when the stock retreats and you do not want large retracements small dips with higher lows are a sign that buyers are still engaged

xb



 technical breakouts  i like to start with a longer term view if the market is breaking through technical resistance on a daily basis i will be more aggressive with my longs and i will expect a bullish trend day if a stock is also breaking through technical resistance i will be more aggressive with my longs i prefer nice clean breaks through that resistance with little to no retracement those moves tend to produce nice orderly price movement and follow through in the chart below the stock rallied above the day ma and it also had a bullish flag formation on a daily chart working in its favor  you will also note that it is in a strong trend on a longer term basis and it was also able to blow through the prior days high

xb



 price action  this applies to the price action of the market and the price action of the stock if the market has lots of mixed green and red candles you know the trend strength is weak if the market has tiny bodied candles it means the current trend is starting to run out of steam the same holds true for the stock in the chart below you will notice consecutive long green candles with little to no overlap this is a sign of incredible trend strength it is very important to watch for these patterns because they will determine if you should ride the trade longer or if you should take gains in the case below you want to hold the stock as long as you can and you should expect a couple of tiny dips along the way bullish flags we also want stocks with nice orderly price action avoid stocks with random choppy price action   

xb



if you factor these elements into your exit strategy you will know when to let the trade run and when to take set passive targets the market is dynamic and your exit strategy should be as well 

trade well",439,thanks this is amazingly helpful im going to save it and then forget to read it properly later,this is incredibly helpful and wellput together to me this is the most helpful post iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) read around the topic much appreciated,"i have a point of contention with  

yes a big move on heavy volume especially a breakout or breakdown is meaningful 

however a lot of the time we see a a continuous bullish trend happen on low volume and what this means is a lack of sellers in the face of a lot of demand and this is a very meaningful condition because it means most current owners expect higher prices 

so dont think that moves have to happen on big volume"
Market trends,options,Does heavy volume in options trading increase the likelyhood of fridays moving in the opposite direction of general market trends (explanation inside)?,"i thought about this yesterday at work and was wondering if some of the more knowledgeable guys here could give me their opinion on this idea

i will explain this theory on the example of a bear market where general market trend is going down because its probably more applicable to the current situation first i am making three core assumptions which i have no data to back up with but seemed reasonable to me confirmation needed

 most options that will be exercised in a bear market are put options
 most options will get exercised on the last day of their life time expiration date
 most options expire on a friday

now we look at what happens when a put option gets exercised again this is my understanding of it and needs confirmation

 the owner of the option is buying the underlying on the market thus creating demand and driving the price up
 he then sells the underlying to whoever wrote the option however the price was allways set in stone from the moment the option was created and the other party has no choice other than to buy the underlying at said price from the option owner so this transaction should have no influence whatsoever on the price of the underlying

the result of this is that on fridays there will be increased demand for underlyings of expiring profitable put options as we see the volume of options trading increase as we have in the last couple of months this effect should become more and more powerful

the same is true for call options in bull markets its just the other way around i dont think i need to explain that too",0,"no because if that were true you could predict it if you can make a prediction about the direction or even just the relative probability of it occurring you could make an easy profit if you could make an easy profit youd take the money and run thus this friday options effect would disappear

Market trends,options,I think I'm done trading options. Here are my opinions. Am I wrong? Civil conversation welcome.,"over the past twelve years i have traded options off and on mostly i have traded defined risk positions and option selling strategies no naked short options i think i have gone long options  long volatility perhaps twice in all those years my account size has been about  or less honestly i am uncomfortable with risk so my trades have been small

some years i have gained  other years iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been flat and this year is my worst year losing  iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) tried to form opinions on stock and volatility direction through fundamental analysis technical analysis and just random trade placement without success my opinions have generally been wrong

this last year i have noticed that my broker has made  from me this year for commissions and fees

where are the customers yachts

one of my worst trades this year was being short vxx in the midst of some changes they made in the calculation or something like that i was assigned shares and experienced a full loss on my spreads i felt i did not have the deep knowledge of the product or access to information fast enough to prevent this

i have ruthlessly studied and have tried to implement dan sheridans methods the tastytrade approach option pit and various other systems

here are my propositions that i put here for conversation  and feel free to correct any one of them i am open to learning conversation and having my opinion changed

 most small retail traders cannot make money specifically in option spread trading
 nondirectional spreads iron condors etc in liquid products do not work because the market tail risk is fatter than a normal distribution would posit
 because of correlation trading numerous products to supposedly spread risk is futile because correlations across asset classes generally go to  on selloffs
 placing more trades to generate more number of occurrences is commission intensive
 the short term retail trader is at the mercy of noisy market movement created by dealers and other major market participants that they cannot predict
 the long term retail trader does not usually have access to the specialized tools pricy platforms or deep knowledge that the professionals have to forecast longer term market trends i am never going to more about the direction of soybeans than a professional commodities trader or analyst will because of this knowledge gap they will make money consistently i will not
 technical analysis candlesticks price patterns macds and rsis etc do not give an edge to the retail trader even though they are highly touted on retail trading platforms most retail indicators are not statistically significant for the end user trend lines and areas of support and resistance have little predictive value other than being engagement tools for individuals
 short index volatility selling strategies are no longer viable for the retail trader
 the broker is the one who consistently makes money in active option trading strategies
 i can find no published studies showing retail traders being consistently profitable in option trading even in the highly touted option selling and monthly income generating strategies

i love markets learning about world economics how financial bubbles burst and how money moves i have tried to capitalize on that love by trading options for over a decade im not sure i will ever be able to make money at it perhaps i should read books about fantastic traders and listen to podcast interviews of professionals and simply dollar cost average my money each month into the sp  at least with strategy i have made money over the last  years and have not paid a broker outrageous sums in commissions

am i wrong anybody else run into these same issues

too long; didn't read i think im done trading options i dont think there is a consistent edge for small retail traders the brokers are the ones who really make money consistently i love markets and should stick to books and podcasts about trading rather than trading myself im open to my opinion being changed

update thank you for all the responses advice commiseration corrections and of course the gentle and much needed ass kicking i have decided to continue options trading but to just keep it small enjoy the trading journey the mental stimulation of market analysis and the privilege of being a small player in these global markets i love my day job so trading is a hobby for me and im now ok with it being just that thanks again to this sub and the mods i will read all the responses but i probably wont be able to respond to them all but i appreciate the time everyone has taken  is taking to respond",221,"i have traded options for over  years  the next option i write will be my first  i stick to buying puts and calls  my strategies are simple and boring but like you i enjoy the markets etc

from your post if you trade options for love of the markets it seems like you have had a cash neutral hobby over the past  years  that is awesome and i hope you take joy in that","well iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been trading for about  years too off and on i blew up  portfolios which mind you  these were my life savings from low wage work i sacrificed a lot to save up that money and poof it was gone over and over i contemplated suicide many times  but it all changed after i decided to stop gambling and learn to manage risk

i took it seriously when i lost my job in  and well decided i would trade a bit to give me some cushion while i looked for work i decided to get technical and just trade probabilities well i started off very well  ill admit i did made some risky plays at first but they turned out well i immediately grabbed those earnings and cashed them this gave me a couple of months of peace of mind anyways i was trading full time successfully for about  months granted this was a small portfolio about k and at the time i had low expenses me and my gf shared a room rental and i was running a very tight budget i just needed about  we each month to not eat into my savings so every time id make  id cash it and consider the month paid i was trading mostly vertical credit spreads  DTE Energy Company (DTE) near the money this kept my risk ratio fairly balanced  i stuck to one direction bullish so most of my trades were selling put premium long story short in  i made  but i will admit it was very stressful and i needed to ramp down even though i had done well the first  months then i just started breaking even and paying a lot in commissions for nothing luckily i found a good job by then

in  i ramped down my trading and just focused on work i would still trade but not low DTE Energy Company (DTE) mostly  swinging vertical put credit spreads  DTE Energy Company (DTE) i made about  that year

this year im up  doing basically the same strategy as last year once i made the  in early december i stopped trading because i am happy with that number the past few weeks iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) just been paper trading new strategies i want to employ in  DTE Energy Company (DTE) ics with stops is so far at least in paper trades proven statistically favorable

so with all that being said its certainly possible to make a profit trading options although ill admit trading for a living is very stressful i prefer to keep working and now trade for supplemental income and its worked out quite well for me perhaps you should consider lowering your risk and taking on a different approach perspective but dont be so hard on yourself trading is not an easy game perhaps you are not cut out for it perhaps you need to try harder smarter whatever you do good luck to you and stay positive","most small retail traders cannot make money specifically in option spread trading

false unless you change cannot to dont its not a matter of whether it is possible or not its a matter of the skillsabilityeducation distribution being skewed below breakeven

there is an equivalent statement about realmoney poker players most dont make money but that doesnt mean you cant make money playing poker and there are several wellknown examples of professional poker players who do make money with option traders theres not world series of option trading to put faces on the tvs of ever home so they are not as well known but they exist

 nondirectional spreads iron condors etc in liquid products do not work because the market tail risk is fatter than a normal distribution would posit

correct observation wrong conclusion

neutral spreads dont work when you misapply them that is the much more common reason for the failure of ics ics want rangebound prices during your holding time and if there are macro reasons for why prices wont be rangebound is it any surprise that ics fail

 because of correlation trading numerous products to supposedly spread risk is futile because correlations across asset classes generally go to  on selloffs

that was certainly true this year but historically this year was unusual it might be the start of a new pattern or it might be a oneoff who knows

that said oilenergy and for a brief time many other commodities were moving opposite to the equity and bond markets so it is still possible to find diversification but it takes active effort and flexibility of mind to be willing to look for diversification that doesnt fit the traditional textbook pattern of bonds vs equity

 placing more trades to generate more number of occurrences is commission intensive

 true so what even if you are paying contractroundtrip you only need to make  x quantity to breakeven if you cant do that you arent trading right my average profit after fees was around contract on over  contracts closed in  that was on contractroundtrip fees

 the short term retail trader is at the mercy of noisy market movement created by dealers and other major market participants that they cannot predict

while that is certainly a contributing factor i think its a bit selfserving shiftingofresponsibility to put all the blame on that how about retail trader mistakes and lack of discipline as a factor id say the impact of the latter is at least x more than the former

ill add a proposition to your pile that is selfevidently true retail traders will blame all their problems on conspiracies and rigged markets x more often than take responsibility for their own trading mistakes

 the long term retail trader does not usually have access to the specialized tools pricy platforms or deep knowledge that the professionals have to forecast longer term market trends i am never going to more about the direction of soybeans than a professional commodities trader or analyst will because of this knowledge gap they will make money consistently i will not

again correct observation wrong conclusion pros have more education skill and resources yes absolutely so what by the same reasoning if you are not a michelin star chef dont bother trying to sell food for a living because you wont make money and yet mom  pop food trucks do just fine its a matter of scale not of capability


 technical analysis candlesticks price patterns macds and rsis etc do not give an edge to the retail trader even though they are highly touted on retail trading platforms most retail indicators are not statistically significant for the end user trend lines and areas of support and resistance have little predictive value other than being engagement tools for individuals

finally an argument i can  agree with without qualification

but again is this the fault of the tool or the tool wielder if you go in thinking that statistical measures that are based on looking at the rearview mirror are going to tell you whats over the next hill thats on you for being a bad driver not on the rearview mirror it did its job

 short index volatility selling strategies are no longer viable for the retail trader

well if you are only considering this year i can understand why you might say that and there is even a chance that it is a true statement going forward but i hope not it certainly wasnt true before 

 the broker is the one who consistently makes money in active option trading strategies

well i wouldnt say the only one but of course the casino owner makes money no matter who wins or loses at the gaming tables thats not new information and thats not an indictment of retail trading its the cost of doing business do you blame the country club for making money on your annual membership fee when you cant break par

 i can find no published studies showing retail traders being consistently profitable in option trading even in the highly touted option selling and monthly income generating strategies

this is just a restatement of your first proposition

final thoughts

finding that a lot of names saw an uptick in net options sentiment which moved higher from the open on thursday in parallel to the market activity and then followed through with similar action on friday the thing about market bottoms on the short or midrange timeframe is that eventually shorts get exhausted and become buyers of the stock covering this could be the case of what we are seeing along with some option buying to the upside buyer is aggressor in the trade

a continue of the bullish trend combined with the gamma squeeze of net option buying may add fuel to the fire to any yearend rally most names are still trading down  from the ytd highs so rallies to the upside still have the chance to be very aggressive  this would usually include a combination of shortcovering funds deploying capital and adding back to positions and gamma squeeze signaling we may be at the end of the bear market

if options continue on the bullish side i wouldnt be surprised to finish the year with a small rally in the indices with more aggressive rally in singular names more likely than not it will be the growth names that have been battered but are still looking good on fundamentals",244,until the fed puts an end to it,sure  its bullish for now,"i hate the moving average as a technical indicator not just because its a lagging indicator but because when you say  
trends arent guaranteed indicators but a follow through of this particular trend would be bullish for stocks  
i can paraphrase that by saying

Market trends,options,Where do full time workers find the time to trade?,"has anyone found jobs or been put in situations that allow them the time to follow the stock market i feel like its close to impossible depending on your situation i work full time in construction and enrolled in university i go  hours  week working and another  on school the only time i was able to learn about options and investing aside from previous knowledge was during early covid where everything was shut down at the time i was an essential employee so i only had about  weeks off before i was called back into work i understood it enough to make decent gains for a small account now i have no time to follow market trends while working even if i set alerts making any moves wont work when im working with or around heavy equipment 
ps i live alone so quitting my job or taking less hours isnt an option",28,ill let you in on a secret i dont have ibs or anything all those bathroom breaks are just to check my account,i work from home so its a bit easier but i did come up with some things that helped  until covid it involved quite a bit of travel as well  i did a write up on it on my blog if youre interested  too long; didn't read dont trade very short term use alerts prestage adjustments,wfh work laptop on one side and stocks graphs and youtube on the other
Market trends,options,Daytrading options. My tips,"i thought i would share a few of the lessons i have learned over the last  months of day trading options for fun i started with about k which i grew to about k before hitting a low earlier this year of about k 

what happened  i was gambling on trades purely guessing about what would happen fighting strong trends trying to time the market not cutting trades early if they went against me im currently at  once i hit k i decided i need to get serious about figuring this thing out or give it up all together i have slowly and consistently been hitting base hits day trading spy for the past  months i might only make  a day but i have done this consistently    these are tips are things that iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) picked up from a variety of sources over my time trading over the past month i have used these tips to limit losses and have very consistent green trading days your mileage may vary only time will tell if i will be profitable long term but i feel these tips are food for thought either way 

in no particular order

try to never let a green trade go red if you arent sure if a trade will continue to go green  you are always better in the long run to sell and watch from the side lines  is always better than  think base hits not home runs  

one of the most critical always  scale out if a trade has momentum in my favor i will always scale out about  of the trade at  profit if im concerned about the momentum i may scale earlier but i always scale at  if i have  invested and the trade is up   total ill sell  and leave  in that leaves me upside potential but protects my money on the downside this has saved me so much anxiety and helps me to be consistent on the upside 

remember the key to making money long term in the stock market is to protect your money limit risk scale out limiting gambling 

focus on one thing i trade spy options learn one stock and learn how it reacts how it moves 

when it comes to spy options i only trade weeklies lower profit than DTE Energy Company (DTE) but if im wrong and i will be wrong i limit my risk and leave myself time to sell a bad trade 

learn to watch for trends enter a trade with a plan if the stock goes against you your plan was wrong sell and move on screw your egoprotect your money 

i have a small account so i limit my trades to  at a time higher than what most recommend but needed with a small account

specific to spy  i have a stock group with the top ten stocks that make up spy this can help me recognize trends is one stock skyrocketing causing spy to move or is it a trend across a wide range 

use a cash account if you trade with less than k you avoid pdt and options settle the next day this will allow you to focus on the trade itself and to quickly sell if you are wrong without worrying about pdt rules 

ill add others but these have been the bedrock of my recent success let me know if you have any good ones",116,i love trading wklys you hit the nail on the head risk management is key to winning,so you turned k into k and youre giving out tips huh welcome,"about you following the top  of spy theres an indicatorstrategy that tries to incorporate this idea on tradingview called top  high low

ps i didnt make this just thought it relevant"

Economic indicators,options,"Expected moves this week: FOMC Minutes, Zoom, Nvidia and more.","stocks had another stong week finishing higher by about  both spx and spy got stuck in the mud for the final  days of last week as they reached a heavy open interest level of  and the gamma took effect essentially pinning the indices to that level as november monthly options approached expiry with those monthly options expired the backdrop changes into this week but it also happens to be a shortened thanksgiving week therefore options are pricing a small move a bit less than  into friday its possible that gamma get reestablished at the same level but it is unlikely we see that sort of gamma pinning we saw last week as the effect wont be as robust to start a new option calendar month

Economic indicators,options,What is going on with the equity market? I am losing my rationality,"hi

first off sorry for the vague title i dont know if this fits here but i decided to take that risk

student here working part time at an institutional asset manager and not a native english speaker i seem to be confused with the current market behaviour as it defies everything iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) learned so far

i would really appreciate if anyone could beat some sense into me and educate me as to why i shouldnt heavily short equities right now

to start let me summarize the current situation note that the selected information will be biased by me even if its not conciously i will mainly focus on the sp  spxgspc for simplicity and structure it like this



 index price and analyst expectations
 indicators and benchmarks
 economic numbers trends news and sentiment

the rant is happening in part  mostly



a analysts targets

during this week i heard about  analysts from banks and asset managers gmjpmcsubs some hedge funds say that they expect the sp to have an upsidepotential to  the expected eoymedian is also  though the expectation for eoy  was only  at the beginning of this year



it seems kind of weird to me how we almost already touched that  upper limit even weirder how every single analyst had the same target for the sp  and every single one said we remain bullish on us equities their explanations havent really convinced me as none of them could really answer the shows hosts on the question why they remain bullish even though were up that far already

we hit ath  times this year with  of them having happened in the last  business days



with earnings ahead i dont get how this should be going even further up especially on the news were facing see further down part 



b volume and vix

 trading volume can signal when an investor should take profits and sell a security due to low activity investopedia
 in the us stock market and many other developed financial markets about  percent of overall trading volume is generated through algorithmic trading
 the algos provide great liquidity when there is no news but when a big new comes in the algos go away until things stabilize

hmm okay we had  business days so far in  and out of the last  there are  days in the top  lowest daily trading volume ytd since  if were supposedly in bullish situation why is the volume going down so rapidly and the trading so frothy are the algos idling to meet the esgbenchmarks or





were also at the lowest vixlevel on the ychart which i learned is usually a sell signal shortterm





c psychological factors sidenote

april has been the best performing month for us equities for the last two decades april was performing netpositive in  out of the last  years excluding 

the best performing equities in april are historically european stocks followed by us stocks

knowing that this month started at  ath im having doubts that the trend will repeat this time though



 technicals

a ma macd

im kind of a believer in the theory that most technical indicators only work because actual systems and people trade by their principles having said that its obviously kind of misleading to use momentum indicators as all of them are giving us strong buy signals even at ath levels



just to note were obviously above moving averages at this point





b rsi pe ratio

its really difficult for me to evaluate the usefulness of valuebased indicators like the buffetindicator or the pe ratio they ignore the decrease in interest rates and the influx of retail money into equities



without that in mind the stockmarket values would look pretty wild at this point



b pe ratio

the same logic applies to pricetoearnings ratios



still  what bothers me is that the pe ratios of us indices are so much higher than the rest of the world



the worst one is not even listed here  the current ratio of the ndx National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ)  lies at 

its as if investors dont expect any growth outside of us companies or am i interpreting that wrong its not like inflation is higher in the us either though there is a certain depreciation in the usd

and if the earnings so obviously dont matter anymore how can analysts like this guy from credit suisse say that the prices are soaring due to the strong earnings src bloomberglink

and lastly i understand the dayrsi crossing  as a sell signal or is that wrong again





 economic data trends news sentiments

oh god here we go i will not provide as much details and pictures so let me summarize the most important points in my opinion a bit

a job market

dateactualexpected

mar 
apr 
apr 

 the weekly joblessclaims reached a pandemicera low  weeks ago mar which resulted in the index going up BP p.l.c. (BP)
 last week we had largerthanexpected jobless claims which resulted in the index going up BP p.l.c. (BP)
 this week we had way largerthanexpected jobless claims which resulted in the index going up BP p.l.c. (BP)

its weird how these numbers were celebrated and being sold as the reason for rising equity prices with one reason being that the fed seemingly only talks about the job numbers as their motivation for propping up the economy

now that the numbers went bad they suddenly do not matter anymore it actually pissed me off how Tommy Hilfiger Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA) Inc (TOM) keene saw these numbers on bloomberg Grupo Televisa S.A. (TV) and said if were being honest how much do these numbers matter anyway they are just transitory like  why did you care about them before then



b inflation and yields fixed income

you guys probably kept an eye on the treasury yields too as they seem to have caused a small taper tantrum in the first days of march analysts expect the y us tr yield to reach about  this year as the treasuries usually act as benchmark for other assets mortgage interest rates and bond rates have spiked as well

this should be bad for highrisk assets also as in high debtratios short to midterm like overvalued stocks as found in the nasdaqspxcomponents news outlets were talking for weeks about the reflation trade and the shift from growth to value stocks there were theories about quant funds shifting big time etc  as it stands were kind of back with our major growth indices though

xb



its not like the treasury yields have retreated much but for some reason the major tech stocks all jumped  to  this week and theyre saying that financial corps will do the same next week

the ppi data released today only indicates even higher inflation expectations  same in other countries like china  actual



i get that higher yields are good for the financial sector and that a depreciation in the usd drives us equities as well and inflation in us  usd loses value Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP) but i still dont see why tech jumped



c risk in the financial sector

with low yields well until recently the leverage ratio increased substantially and even the feds balance sheet kind of imploded due to the pandemic there is so much money in the market and so much leverage just so guaranteed rates can be delivered  i wonder how this is not a sign of risk to anyone

we just had the bust of a fund with archegos that erased about usd  billion of market value and a similar picture with greensill capital or the supposed shortsellers of equities in january even after this credit suisse somehow thinks that they have proper risk management laugh out loud and i wish i wouldnt have to say that about one of our national banks  sigh oh and somehow citibank just lost m in some transactions woops



d tax revolution

the current projects on better international tax collaboration higher corporate and individual taxes a minimum tax rate for companies etc all of this sounds like bad news for companies but somehow it gets ignored someone help me on this please



e vaccination progress

at the current rate we will achieve global herd immunity in  with cases rising again in europe and developingindustrial countries



it seems like the lagging progress outside of the us doesnt concern the market in the least as we can see with aths on european and asian indices i guess Tommy Hilfiger Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA) Inc (TOM) keene would say that these numbers are irrelevant anyway



f chip shortage

major car manufacturers halted production General Motors Corporation (GM) ford this week and many tech products cant meet demand due to the delay in production like the current macbooks its a consensus that this issue will stay for a few years since the building of factory sites and so on usually takes a few years



this is pretty bad news right obviously this means that the market has to go up like  i dont understand this is an obvious issue but somehow these stocks just go up 



there are many other bad news like the ukraine conflict where talks about a possible war exist or the oil price dilemma and uncertain future of crypto currencies but im leaving it at this right now



lastly i want to note my personal destain for bloomberg news as they seem to be publishing some weird articles lately there are major news but they kind of spin it into good news and for example talk about the potential of spx hitting  this week instead i mostly resorted to reuters and selected smaller outlets last week for this reason



ok guys thats it i would be happy to have someone explain me why i should be bullish on the spx i just loaded up on puts structured products after losing most of my portfolio this week on rather heavily leveraged puts

thanks to anyone for reading this

if asked i can provide sources on all the info though i dont want to link all the sources right away as it takes too much time",49,this will continue to run as long as cheap money is readily available,i think youre missing the point of market commentary the point is to not get fired that is all,deleted
Economic indicators,options,"Expected moves this week: VERY low IV in SPY/SPX, earnings from Salesforce, Crowdstrike and more.","spyspx was higher by about  in holidayshortened trading last week slightly more than what options were pricing the gamma weve discussed in these posts that held spx near the  level mostly expired after nov monthly expiration the week before but the thanksgiving week saw low volumes and not a ton of volatility to give an indication of what type of option backdrop well see over the next few weeks if we were to see some volatility before year end it would most likely come in the next two weeks while the gamma forces are not as significant and theres a decent amount of economic data and fedspeak

implied vol is very low across the board the vix closed friday near  at the money iv in spyspx is below  for several days this week the vix has been a straight line down from  in late october as discussed previously that can have a selffulfilling crush on both implied vol and realized vol loading the market up with gamma while market makers drastically lower option bids across the board to stop drowning in long premium those conditions often lead to a slow creep higher where the risk on option selling each day is to the upside with expected moves so narrow the conditions would most likely flip with an accelerating selloff in stocks where investors finally looked to buy protection again whether that occurs in any way this week or next remains to be seen if it does not we then reenter a holiday period at yearend and a december expiry that could once again be loaded with gamma before now and then there are this weeks gdp pce and a powell speech next week is an important jobs number and after that is cpi so some things to watch for on the calendar

Economic indicators,options,Beginning Indicators,"trading involves technical analysis reading the charts and what each candlestick means and the shapes and indicators involved one of my favorite and very useful tools for charting not on the brokerage platform is tradingview tradingview has a lot of resources from livestream trading cryptocurrency and new ideas to look at theres a lot i havent explored that can entertain any trader so here i just wanted to provide some of the indicators that can help initial readings and possibly go into more complex indicators

rsi relative strength index relative strength index measures whether a stock is being overbought or oversold lower rsi indicates people have sold more and that you could be looking for an increase in buying two points to watch are when rsi is close to  meaning its moving towards overbought and  meaning its oversold

macd moving average convergencedivergence macd helps show the price movement moving average on a shorter period versus a longer period tradingview shows a shorter exponential moving average as blue with the signal line the longer exponential moving average as red the short ema will always meet the long ema but it helps determine possible uptrends or downtrends when the blue line crosses the red line crossing downward is bearish and upward is the opposite macd can contain gold and death crosses gold cross has the blue line shoot up through the red line creating a cross and a bullish indicator death cross has the blue line drop through the red line a bearish signal

mfi money flow index money flow index is similar to rsi in that it can also help determine overbought or oversold areas with usual indicators at  and  similar indications to rsi using mfi with rsi can help spot divergences if rsi and the stock go up but mfi is down this can signal a reversal in price

adl advancedecline line adl helps determine the amount of shares being bought or sold a positive number showing more bullish indication and negative showing bearish spikes in adl can show possible artificial breakout without justification in price movement a great example below we see a spike in adl but not much of an increase in price so shows possible fake breakout and artificial increase in truly advancing stocks

bollinger bands bollinger bands help identify when a stock might be trading outside their price range bollinger bands are usually set at  standard deviations away from the price as statistically stdev is considered an outlier this can help identify a breakout from its trading range or retest the bollinger bands and come back inside its range

vwap volume weighted average price if volume is king vwap is queen vwap recommended by shorter time frames is the average price the stock is trading at taking volume into account if a stock is trading above vwap you can most likely expect it to come down to the average price tending towards equilibrium as economics rule  overall its important to use multiple indicators as they can tell different stories and using them on multiple timelines can also help you determine what the short term and long term prospects",34,i love vwap for day trading,i use Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) and bollinger bands among others in my scanning criteria but my charts are clean when i first started trading the candles were hidden behind all sorts of squiggles and when they didnt work it was confusing now my charts are devoid of any indicators and i rely on price action alone and that includes not utilizing  candlestick patterns,its important to learn price action as indicators are lagging and can be self fulfilling also do not stack the same type of indicators and think it means multiple buy signals i see this alot people will use rsi and skd thinking because they line up it means signals when in truth you are just looking at two indicators that mimic one another as they are the same type it would help to explain there are different types of indicators and combination of different types of indicators gives better signals but price action is still king if you really wanna be a winner you need to be an expert at it

stock,options,Tech stocks are overbought right now,qqq is maxed out on the dailyweekly rsi being propped up by nvidias  run this month im thinking about buying a large position on qqq puts expiring on the th does tech still have more room to run next week or is it losing steam,175,buy puts and get burned with the rest of the rational folks,"the old adage that the market can stay solvent longer than you is not a myth i still remember in the beginning of my trading activity of buying puts on Apple Computer, Inc. (AAPL) because it was too overbought for too long it was an expensive lesson",next week apple presentation i wouldnt bet against technology this week x
stock,options,Best Covered Call Stocks,"i see a few others here are trading ccs who has some good ideas for Circuit City Stores, Inc. (CC) candidates right now lets share some ideas with the numbers

i trade wellknown companies with low stock prices and relatively low margin requirements i look for stocks where the bid for the weekly option is  or more of the current stock price

as always stocks and options involve risk and ccs are no different and this is not advice just discussion

aa is another one of my regular ccs it is trading at  the margin requirement is also  meaning a  shares would require capital of about  the  call has a bid of  this is around a  return and another  if it assigns even though it pays a little less than x this price level is less elevated than x right now

i know these returns sound like nothing compared to wsb short squeezes but these are weekly returns and they add up quick i usually have  shares of x in my portfolio and regularly collect  in premium and extra when it assigns i use it to pay for some options and shares in wsb stocks like wkhs

stock,options,‘Meme’ stock prices may not properly reflect demand -NYSE president,"xb

this article has a lot of implications for options and not just meme stocks basically this is saying all options are potentially manipulated it has sent a chill down my spine about options in general iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) made some good money in options but also lost a lot too and more recently 

how many times have i seen a stock trending upward and suddenly reverse course only to end up finishing the week right on top of max pain 

how many times must i see obv barely move and yet a stock is tanking 

i will watch level  and see the bid filled with way more orders than the ask and yet the stock is tanking

trade,options,The Genius Behind Nany Pelosi's Trades,"one of the greatest traders of our time  nancy pelosi joking aside i was looking through her recent trades and couldnt help but notice how well structured they are her choices for the longs are very similar to how i set up my diagonals

 shes using long calls as a surrogate long stock position to take advantage of the leverage afforded by options for example the Google Inc. (GOOG) trade cost around k for her to put on a similar stock trade wouldve been around mm
 she uses two different long call strategies based on her disposition towards the stock
    for more developed equities like Google Inc. (GOOG) mu dis she selected slightly shorter term expirations but went further itm this allows the trade to behave more like long stock while decreasing the impact of theta decay on the options
    for more growth oriented equities like rblx and Salesforce.com Inc (CRM) she selected leap expirations and chose strikes closer to the money although still itm this offers more growth opportunity in the options if directionally correct while still limiting the impact of theta decay on the longs
 she selected all established products with promising lines of business going forward dis surprised me a little bit but since covid theyve been pivoting more and more to telecomm so i can understand her thought process the
 the choices she made are not the cheapest method to gain exposure however these are well structured trades diamond hands pelosi at it again

edits for all the keyboard warriors  
im not suggesting that pelosi is actually any kind of great trader  the post is generally satire the focus is more on the construction of the trades  
the post isnt about how she selects the products if theres insider trading etc   
to clarify nancys husband makes most of the trades and she is required to report them i have absolutely no idea who is actually structuring the trades if they have an advisor etc again calling her the great trader is more of a joke than anything",1410,im hoping someone makes an etf called senate or something to track the trades i would wheel that etf so hard,people keep saying she when her husband actually owns an investment firm,isnt her husband in vc or something similar i think technically her trades are actually executed by her husband it woukd make sense theyre so well constructed given his background
trade,options,Quit trading,"hello whoever took the time to read this i dont really know how to start this but  whatever i just really need to vent and have someone listen 
i was slapped with the hand of reality yesterday after a fight with my girlfriend shes felt that since iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) started trading which was a little over a year and a half ago iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) become less patient  irritable ultimately being the reason why our relationship has been falling apart 

im the type of person that when i get really into something i try to be the very best at whatever it is thus this is the mindset that i took when learning the ins and outs of trading options 
like most i started out on robinhood and as i felt more comfortable i opened an account with Toronto Dominion Bank (The) (TD) ameritrade i started with around a thousand dollars which coming for me is a kind of a stretch for me at the time

fast forward i became absorbed by the markets  trading on the weekends i researched and planned plays for the week  i couldnt wait for monday to get back in there and trade i love trading it excites me its fun it makes me feel like im doing something with my life however the emotions that came with it seemed to take a toll on me  my relationship the losses would  impact the mood for the rest of my day i would just be really upset at myself for  not being smarter she would constantly support me day in and day out not financially but emotionally 
i would take time off to get my head straight and then give it another go

nonetheless history repeats itself  nothing changed id still get upset with myself over the losses  would start to sell some of my personals to make enough to keep trading i know ill probably get shit for having a gambling addiction i just would have the mindset of not quitting and not giving up not wanting to become a failure 

all said  done she finally told me that giving up trading all together was just not for me  i just feel useless aside from working my shity job i dont have anything that i can put my mind and energy into that makes me feel productive and good like im working towards something 

tomorrow is monday  im dreading it because my mornings from now till god knows when are just meh

that way you can get the experience of trading options without paying the tution of learning by failing so to speak from your savings  just dont set your paper trade account to start with some insane amount of money trade it like its your real capital otherwise there is no point

trade,options,Don’t Trade Options,"if you dont have a written plan the goal of this post is to share personal mistakes in my early trading to hopefully encourage others down a different path 

people tend to hate those kind of statements because it makes us feel inadequate and that were doing something wrong however i can unequivocally say transitioning from trading off the dome to writing a plan is massive and probably one of the largest changes to my trading success 

i started trading in high school so i scoffed at the idea of having to write things out i figured i could just look at my logs adjust based on what i saw and do just fine looking back  years i want to slap my cocky naive self 

options are incredibly complex products and millions of people try their hand at it and we know the majority fail the arrogance i had thinking that as late teen early  year old i would just be able to successfully deploy without a written plan or log is literally wild 

if the idea sounds like work and annoying to do  youre spot fucking on as it should be just because the barrier to enter into trading is so low dont allow that to lull you into a false sense of security 

the real benefit of a trading plan isnt using the finished plan as a reference although it is a good one the benefit comes from the rigor put into creating one and the exercise itself similar to when i was giving a  paragraph order as a marine officer  i very rarely would crack open my plan to remind myself what to do in a scenario i didnt need to because i knew it cold from building and delivering the plan same exact goes for trading 

if you have a plan or pieces of one and want some feedback post it here and lets have a constructive dialogue about them if you dont have one below is a simple outline to get you started 

 orientation what is the goal of your trading this should be quantified we should also force ourself to answer is my goal realistic why do i think it is how can i track whether it is or not

 portfolio deployment how do you intend to use your portfolio manage risk assess markets etc 

 tools this can be everything from notes tafa tools chart setups market functions etc 

 strategy outlines this breaks the strategy down into a full lifecycle in depth whats the idea of the strat how does it make money how does it lose how do you manage pnl how does that affect expectancy what deltas do you use why how do you scale

 tracking this is where we track and quantify our ideas questions and assumptions this enables unbiased analysis and optimization 

 audits im a firm believer in having people i respect look over my work to poke holes identify gaps confirm rigor 

yes its work yes its worth it this is how iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) maintained a  cagr for over  years


edit it seems we need to add context because many have a broken sense of market potential 

i see  would make him one of the best money managers or theres no way someone can make that return or you did that during a bull market who cares

this mindset simply gives ourselves an out on our own performance and is a lazy way to excuse ourselves from actually trying to get better 

if we chalk something up to luck chance or throw it away as impossible theres no imperative for us to look more closely at ourselves 

moreover youll find that fund managers are the wrong benchmark to compare good performance against they tend to underperform for many reasons 

i highly encourage you to monitor the results of the us investing championship i have for years i am a solid consistent trader and am proud of my performance but this will give you a much better idea of what really good looks like

trade,options,I analyzed all the controversial trades made by Senators in the 2020 Congressional insider trading scandal. Here are the results!,"preamble  the ability of congress members to trade stocks has been controversial from the start there have been multiple stories covering the  congressional  where congress members allegedly used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash but none of the articles talked about the financial implications of those trades and whether the retail investors could have frontrun the market using the disclosed data  basically what i wanted to know was

how much did the senators save by offloading their positions before the crash and could i have done the same

where is the data from efdsearchsenategov

for my  i used data from senatestockwatchercom but not all the transactions are captured on the website and i wanted to match exactly with the trades reported by famous journals efdsearchsenategov is the united states official website where senator former senator and candidate financial disclosure reports are available some of the data is available as a scanned file and some in normal html format i had to manually transcribe most of the data used in this analysis

in case you are wondering about the time delay between the actual transaction and reporting congress members are expected to  the median delay in reporting that i observed for all the trades was  days

all the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end

analysis

there are multiple factors at play here

timeline on january   the senate committees on health and foreign relations held a closed meeting with only senators present to brief them about the covid outbreak and how it would affect the united states i am considering this as the start time for my analysis any sale made by the senators after this point up to feb  is considered i did not consider sales beyond that point as spy dropped  during that week my assumption here is its realistic for any person be it a normal investor or a senator to panic sell after seeing that drop for reference spy dropped an additional  over the next  weeks  

senators under consideration i have considered trades done by  senators in my analysis i have focused on these  as all of them were investigated by  following the trading scandal

 richard burr
 kelly loeffler
 james m inhofe
 david a perdue



david perdue sold  times  mm in the  days following the closed senate meeting interestingly james inhofe only transacted  times but the combined value of shares he sold was a whopping mm the most ironic part is that richard burr who was under investigation the longest and had to step down from the intelligence committee due to the scandal had the least dollar volume in the transaction mm

results

before we dive into the overall amount saved by the senators and the retail investor side of the analysis lets see what were the best trades made by the senators during that time period  



david perdue absolutely killed it with his stock plays he is present  times in the top  list and his best play caesars entertainment reduced  after he sold his position fun fact if a stock reduces  it has to go up  just to reach back to its initial price another interesting observation from the chart is that senators mainly sold stocks related to the entertainment and hospitality industries which were the most severely affected industries due to the pandemic



the above chart showcases the amount of money saved by the senators due to front running the market crash david perdue saved an insane mm with his stock sales i also kept a multiple of annual senate salary to showcase the scale of impact they made to their portfolio because of the trades

finally we come to the milliondollar question was it possible for the retail investors to follow these trades and frontrun the crash

this is where the analysis gets a bit tricky  of the transactions were reported by march rd but if you consider it in dollar values only  of the transactions were reported some of the highvalue transactions were reported only after the crash but if you were an astute investor you could have observed a stark difference in what the senators were saying and how they were trading for eg  for the pandemic but then sold mm worth of stocks in the next two weeks i know that hindsight is  but if you could have connected these two dots then you could have saved up to  of your portfolio before the crash

limitations of analysis there are some limitations to the analysis

a i have only used one black swan event for the analysis a better method would be to analyze the stock trading pattern over  major crashes and see if any pattern emerges but the current limitation is that efdsearchsenategov has only data since 

b there is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by congress members the disclosure is always in ranges eg k  k so for calculating the transaction amount i have taken the average of the given range

conclusion

i intentionally left out the party affiliation of the senators as i did not want our political views clouding our financial judgment i could not find a single example where a retail investor or an institutional investor or even a hedge fund leveraging this information to make their trades it might just not be public another possible explanation here is that senators might just have superior stock trading capability as 

however you view it this analysis in addition to my  showcases that there is significant money to be made by following their trades closely

Stock market,EducatedInvesting,"(Guide) What Is a Stock Market Crash, and What Causes Them?","a stock market crash is a sudden doubledigit decline in share prices discover how to prepare an investment portfolio for a looming crash 



a stock market crash is defined as a rapid and unexpected drop in the price of stocks and shares they are typically shortlived events but can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks and in some cases they even evolve into a 

there isnt a specified threshold by which stocks have to drop below to be classified as a crash however most investment professionals agree that a crash is considered to have happened after a sudden doubledigit percentage drop in a  such as the  or sp 

the terms stock market crash correction pullback and bear market are often used interchangeably however there are some stark differences between the three

 stock market pullback  a shortterm drop between  and  that usually occurs over a few days
 stock market correction  a steady decline in stock prices between  and  over several weeks or months
 stock market crash  a rapid decline in stock prices greater than  over a short space of time
 bear market  a prolonged decline in stock prices by more than  in extreme cases a bear market can last for years

 what causes a stock market crash

the catalysts behind each stock market crash throughout history have been quite different but a common theme that emerges across nearly all past events is a weakening economic outlook as consumers slow their spending corporate earnings struggle to achieve growth which can spark uncertainty especially if stock valuations have reached high levels

some common factors that can trigger the start of a crash or correction include

 high inflation
 rising interest rates
 natural disasters
 overvalued stocks
 geopolitical disputes
 economic uncertainty
 excess speculation
 low investor sentiment

looking at the various stock market crashes throughout history reveals just how diverse the causes of these events can be

  the covidcrash

in early  stock markets worldwide plummeted as entire countries went into lockdown due to the covid pandemic with nonessential businesses being forced to close and international travel banned global economies ground to a halt and for many companies especially smaller ones this series of events led to bankruptcy

however following a massive injection of government stimulus western economies were able to bounce back at a record pace and with  days the ftse  and sp  indices had completely recovered before being propelled to new record highs

  the global financial crisis

after years of loose lending practices for mortgages by american banks the us housing market became propped up on a massive pile of subprime loans eventually millions of people across the country could not keep up with mortgage payments leading to a surge in foreclosures the market became flooded with properties and no one to buy them causing house prices to plummet

to make matters worse investment banks were using complex derivatives such as collateralised debt obligations cdos to hide the level of risk within mortgage bonds with bond rating agencies selling high ratings to the same investment banks individual and professional investors unknowingly purchased extremely highrisk assets this was particularly problematic for pension funds across the united states and europe

after default rates began to skyrocket mortgage bonds collapsed causing an estimated Trinity Industries, Inc. (TRN) of losses worldwide at the end of the financial crisis the sp  tumbled by as much as  and it took approximately  months for the stock market to recover

  the dotcom bubble

as the internet began to take the investment community by storm onlinebased technology stocks became immensely popular including businesses which didnt even have a revenue stream as mania took over the valuation of technology stocks reached absurd levels pushing the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) up by more than  between  and 

eventually the bubble burst and the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) collapsed by  it would take  years before the index would return to its same level of valuation

  the oil crisis

the stock market crash in  was a fairly complicated situation triggered by many different factors the us economy was already weakened after the decision to engage in the vietnam war pairing this with increased social spending caused the countrys deficit to skyrocket

at the time the us dollar followed the gold standard which meant the federal reserve had little control over economic policy this ultimately led to the abolition of the gold standard in america in  two years later the organisation of arab petroleum exporting countries opec introduced an oil embargo on all countries that supported israel in the arabisraeli war the united states and the united kingdom were on the list

what followed was a sudden supply shock for oil prices for the fossil fuel more than tripled in a matter of weeks and crippled the us economy for nearly a decade the dow jones industrial average dropped by as much as  while the uks ft  index  one of the oldest indices in the world  dropped by as much as 

the stock recovered within  months but what followed was nearly a decade of multiple recessions triggering one of the longest bear markets in history

  the great depression

following the roaring s after world war  the us economy expanded rapidly with the nations wealth more than doubled as the economy was booming the level of speculation on wall street started to get out of hand with seemingly everyone pouring their money into stocks and shares and many were even using margin to try and amplify their returns

the dow jones industrial average hit its  after a slight slowdown in us production and an increase in unemployment investors started to get spooked resulting in a panicselling frenzy that saw a record  million shares being sold off on whats now known as black thursday

things seemed settled for a few days but then on october  now known as black tuesday this record trading volume was beaten with  million shares being sold off investors across the united states saw their investments collapse and most who were using margins put themselves in personal bankruptcy

the great depression is by far one of the worst declines in the history of financial markets by the time the dust had settled the dow jones had dropped by  and it would take close to  years to recover to its former high

 are market crashes bad for investors

as horrendous as experiencing a stock market crash firsthand can be it can also provide some rare advantages

as most investors enter into a panicselling frenzy plenty of highquality businesses can get caught in the crossfire some tremendous buying opportunities can emerge for those capable of identifying the strong enterprises from the weak while valuations plummet

the downward trend of the stock market can also cool down overheated stock prices driven by speculation rather than underlying fundamentals this can be beneficial if asset price inflation starts to get out of control

of course these advantages come paired with some pretty severe setbacks for investors especially shortterm traders sudden downward pressure leaves little time for individuals to pull their capital out of the market before stock prices plummet and all too often investors sell after shares have already collapsed leading to the destruction of wealth

the severity of this effect is also often amplified by traders shortselling to try and profit from the decline of stock prices depending on how bad the situation gets and the underlying trigger stock market crashes can transform into a deeper bear market and even an economic recession

so are stock market crashes bad yes but they also create lucrative opportunities for prudent investors

 how often does the stock market crash

a stock market crash by its nature is unpredictable while there are leading indicators suggesting a down period may be due to occur these are often wrong and even professional investors constantly make predictions that fail to materialise

having said that on average a stock market crash occurs once every seven years at least thats what history has shown but in practice this schedule is rarely followed for example after the  global financial crisis it took nearly  years before another crash occurred in  marking one of the longest  in history for the investors that sold their shares in  as per the sevenyear schedule missed out on another five years of stock market growth

 how long does a market crash last

the duration of a stock market crash ultimately depends on what caused it in the first place for example a severe economic downturn will take far longer to recover than a shortterm supply shock

looking at the sp  since  reveals that roughly  of stock market crashes and  last between two weeks to three and a half months before reaching the bottom however on average it can take up to  months before shares recover to their former levels

 how can investors prepare for a stock market crash

while a stock market crash is incredibly difficult to predict that doesnt mean investors cant prepare and several steps can be taken to mitigate the impact of a market downturn on an investment portfolio

 build a cash buffer  one of the biggest mistakes investors make during a stock market crash is to sell shares after the price has collapsed however those who need money to cover living expenses may have no choice but to sell at a terrible price this risk can be mitigated by ensuring sufficient cash is kept in reserve in a savings account
 diversify  stock market crashes can hit different industries at varying degrees of severity the risk of owning shares in the most heavily impacted industry is reduced by ensuring a portfolio containing a wide range of sectors similarly allocating capital across a broad range of alternative asset classes such as bonds and real estate can further mitigate the impact of rapidly declining stock prices
 keep spare capital  with panicking investors selling off anything with a pulse rare buying opportunities for topnotch companies may emerge by ensuring some capital is kept in reserve investors will have the money to capitalise on these investment opportunities

 what should investors do during a market crash

for investors seeking to capitalise on the buying opportunities that a stock market crash can create a few considerations need to be taken into account the most prominent is the heightened level of volatility

when investor sentiment is low the slightest bit of bad news can send stocks plummeting even if an investor identifies a terrific company trading significantly below its intrinsic valuation shares can still fall further trying to predict when the market or an individual stock has hit its lowest point is a nearimpossible task

fortunately there are a few tactics that investors can deploy to mitigate downside risk

   instead of investing all residual capital in one go investors can break it up into smaller chunks and dripfeed it into the markets that way investors can buy more at an even better price if an undervalued stock continues to fall each time a lower price is paid the average cost per share in an investment falls reducing the impact of further price declines after the initial trade
 stoploss orders  to protect against downside risk investors can set up a stoploss order this is a set of instructions given to a brokerage firm that states that if a companys share price falls below a certain threshold the broker should sell the investors shares this can reduce the impact of a severe valuation decline
 stoplimit orders  this type of trade works similarly to a stoploss order however the key difference is that the investor doesnt close out their entire position instead they can specify how many shares should be sold if a stock price falls below a specified threshold this also works in reverse instead of selling shares a stoplimit order can be used to buy a specified number of shares once the stock price meets a specified price level

 the bottom line

stock market crashes are mostly unpredictable and inevitable events that come with the territory of investing investors should construct their portfolios with this risk factor in mind and ensure that sufficient financial planning has been performed in case the worst comes to pass

 

the stock market is reeling from the growing level of inflation and with so many fantastic businesses trading at massive discounts now could be the perfect time for savvy investors to snatch up some potential bargains

Stock market,EducatedInvesting,The Stock Market and the upcoming election,"first off i want to start by saying that we should focus on the question and not make this a political discussion as it wont really yield any positive results

i would like to get your opinion on what you are doing with your portfolio prior to and after this upcoming us election

as weve seen the small caps market has been getting hit hard while the big caps are having a field day this is expected and many traders say this period is normally like this very slow and even with good news or catalysts theres very little movement on the small caps

i am expecting a very contentious election with results that may take days to count or a decision that may be legally challenged by either party 
i believe that the market will react to this but i dont know how

part of me is thinking on selling off before the election and keep my liquidity until after the storm but im also considering putting some of this weight into gold and metals because its what based on my little experience with commodities some investors tend to go for during times of economic panic

so whats your plan for your portfolio",28,"my portfolio is heavily invested in green energy mostly solar

there is a small chance that there will be a green new deal with biden harris more harris than biden but biden would sign it

that would be solar sky rocketing

if this does not happen the stocks will continue to rise either way because it is the future that i can see the question is how fast we get there

too long; didn't read solar stock goes up",deleted,i cant see faang slowing down any time soon people talk about a tech bubble burst but i dont see it simply based on faang every chegg peleton whatever company could start to crash and these five could just buy them up i see an Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) bubble before tech them and their chinese clones  also i dont see a repeat of march happening during covid  electric buggaloo im dumb though
Stock market,EducatedInvesting,"What Is A Stock Market Index, and How Do They Work?","a stock market index is a performance tracker of a collection of shares representing a specific segment of the financial markets they can be designed to follow a particular industry heed to a specific investing style or encapsulate large portions of the overall stock market

in the united kingdom the  is often considered the gold standard as a proxy for the british economy whereas in the united states the  is the most popular benchmark index



how can investors use a stock market index

investors can use stock market indices for a variety of purposes some of the most common include

 tracking market sentiment  investors can review trends in popular indices to gain insight into how positive or negative investor sentiment currently is comparing the day and day moving averages is a common technique used by traders to see which direction stock prices are likely to move in the shorttomedium term
 an investment  investors cannot directly invest in an index however its possible to buy shares in an  that replicates the hypothetical portfolio of an index by doing this investors will be able to replicate the performance of the underlying index and since the fund manager handles all the portfolio rebalancing this approach essentially puts an investment portfolio on autopilot
 performance benchmark  some investors prefer to build a custom portfolio by  and often these individuals will want to compare their returns against a suitable index after all if a custom portfolio is struggling to keep up or surpass a stock market index it may be prudent for the investor to change their investment strategy
 calculating expected returns  knowing the average rate of return delivered by an index over a specific period can help investors be more realistic with their personal return expectations this can help lead to better financial planning for the future
 calculating beta  beta represents the volatility of a stock relative to a stock market index and one of the most popular methods of estimating beta is by running a linear regression between stock price percentage return against an indexs percentage returns

how to analyse a stock market index

while stock market indices are relatively simple financial instruments they have a few characteristics that can complicate things lets go through the steps investors need to take when trying to analyse or understand an index and how they are designed to work

 check what the index tracks

when searching for an index investors need to make sure they select an appropriate one for example lets say an investor wants to compare the performance of their custom  portfolio

they could opt to use the ftse  like most investors however given the level of concentration within the energy sector it will likely be more meaningful to compare performance against an energy index

 check what companies are inside the index

after creating a list of seemingly suitable stock market indices an investor may find value in looking closer at which companies are in the index being considered some indices have eligibility requirements such as a minimum market capitalisation

if the investors renewable energy portfolio predominantly consists of risky  using an energy index that requires its constituents to have a large market cap will likely be unsuitable

 check how the index is weighted

every index assigns weightings to each of its constituent stocks and depending on the method used some stocks may have a larger influence on the indexs performance than others

some of the most common index weighting methods include

 market capitalisation weighted  the companies within the index with the largest market capitalisation have a greater weighting than those with smaller valuations this means largecap stocks have more influence on the performance of an index than smallercap ones
 floatadjusted market capitalisation weighted  index constituents are weighted the same way as the market capitalisation weighted method however the market caps of each stock are adjusted to remove the effects of noninvestable shares as such any shares held by controlling investors or government institutions are excluded the ftse  and sp  are both examples of a floatadjusted market capweighted index
 priceweighted  the companies within an index are weighted based on their share price therefore stocks that trade at a higher stock price have more influence on the indexs performance than shares trading at low prices note that market capitalisation does not have any impact on the weighting decision even if a company has a market cap of Trinity Industries, Inc. (TRN) it may still have a lower weighting than a Banta Corporation (BN) firm if the share price is trading lower the  is an example of a priceweighted index
 equalweighted  every index constituent has the same weighting regardless of market cap or stock price
 volumeweighted  the weighting of index constituents is determined by how frequently their shares are being traded the companies with a higher average trading volume will receive the greatest weighting
 fundamental weighting  the weight of each stock in an index is determined based on some fundamental metric such as revenue earnings cash flow or book value the firms with the highest fundamental values will have the highest weighting

leading uk stock indices

the list of  is long however some of the most popular indices used as benchmarks include

 ftse aim   this index includes the largest  uk stocks by market capitalisation which have their primary listing on the alternative investment market aim
 ftse allshare  an index that contains all the listed companies on the main 

leading us stock indices

multiple us stock market indices are quoted regularly within financial media and the investing community some of the most popular include

   contains  of the most prominent publically traded businesses in the united states
 National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ)   this index consists of the  largest and most actively traded listed companies on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) stock exchange
 russell   a market cap index that measures the performance of the  smaller companies listed in the united states

how to invest in a stock market index

as previously mentioned a stock market index is not a tradable financial security its merely a hypothetical portfolio designed to track specific industries or sections of the stock market as such investing in an index is not actually possible

however investors can replicate an indexs performance with a lowcost index fund weve written a  to investing in an index fund however the process can be briefly summarised into three primary steps

 choose an index
 pick an appropriate fund
 buy shares in the fund

the bottom line

stock market indices can be a useful tool for performance benchmarking as well as for more advanced investing computations understanding how they function and the roles they play can help investors discover new investment opportunities

Fundamental analysis,EducatedInvesting,"Introduction to Fundamental Analysis: Definition, Components, Macroeconomic Indicators","there are two types of analysis used in investing and trading  fundamental and technical the first type allows you to assess the real value of an asset and its capabilities and prospects while the second one studies the price change in trading a price change is necessary to determine the entry and exit points

fundamental analysis definition

fundamental analysis makes it possible to understand how attractive the acquisition of the shares is and what their growth prospects are all investment processes originate from analytics the decision to buy or sell a stock is based on various economic indicators it can be inflation the situation on the world market changes in gdp etc there is always a definite correlation between all these indicators fundamental analysis allows you to notice this correlation study it and make an optimal choice

fundamental analysis involves studying accounting and financial statements of companies in order to determine the real value of assets so the influence of the economy and the political situation in the country and in the world the position of the company and the actions of competitors are taken into account fundamental analysis requires constant control of the market since any news can have an enormous impact on the market therefore players speculating in the market exit the deal in order not to lose much during the publication of important news due to the trading turbulence

fundamental analysis components

fundamental analysis flows from graham and dodds book security analysis it proposes fundamental analysis components it consists of macroeconomic analytics then industry sectoral analytics the study of the issuing company and the valuation of the securities graham was a successful investor warren buffett is also a famous example of the use of fundamental analysis

fundamental analysis methods

lets move on to the methods of fundamental analysis the following classical methods of analysis are most often used in fundamental analysis

 comparison of the object of study with other objects
 correlation is used to study the dependence of objects that means to measure how changes of one object affect the changes of another
 deduction and induction imply a transition from the general to the particular characteristics of the industry as a whole and a particular company or from the particular to the general studying of previous data of the companys activities and their impact on economic indicators
 seasonality involves the influence of cycles of production social or weather processes on the formation of prices
 generalization and grouping mean the division of the issuers indicators into groups according to certain characteristics such a study should be carried out on the basis of the companys balance sheet

step    macroeconomic indicators

the fundamental analysis begins with the research of trends in the global economy as a whole then you move on to the research of the economy of countries and industries macroeconomic indicators include gdp growth the inflation rate and the central bank rate

stable gdp growth signals that the countrys economy is developing and the national currency is getting stronger such a signal is important since due to the depreciation of the currency part of the profit from assets in this currency can be eaten up if gdp grows it means that funds are being poured into the stock market and in this case there are more chances to earn money on it

the central banks rates represent the cost of money the availability of loans and consumer demand when interest rates are low the value of shares increases since enterprises can get cheap loans and direct these funds to production in addition if domestic demand grows the products of enterprises are bought more actively

the unemployment rate significantly affects consumer demand as well as the efficiency of enterprises

also oil prices gold and foreign exchange reserves and the level of the money supply are additionally studied its also important to pay attention to the current policy of the government and the central bank

thus fundamental analysis is based on the research of macroeconomic indicators industries companys position and on the analysis of securities in the article we have considered the first stage of the analysis in the near future  indicators of fundamental analysis are planned to be added to moninvais platform for more accurate forecasts",13,good stuff,nan,nan

Fundamental analysis,EducatedInvesting,"Fundamental Analysis: Attractiveness of the industry, Financial Ratios, Book and Market values","in the first part of the article we got acquainted with fundamental analysis and studied the first stage of fundamental assessment  the analysis of macroeconomic indicators in the second part we will focus on industry attractiveness levels and financial ratios

step  analysis of the attractiveness of the industry

the industries are analyzed depending on their investment attractiveness and liquidity here are the sectoral types of investment attractiveness

 crisis industry its feature is a great drop in production
 depressive industry stagnant development prospects are either lacking or unclear
 stable industry the growth of the industry can be described as stable and promising and its performance is above the national average
 a promising industry has the potential for development and investments under clear targeted comprehensive programs its feature is a small volume of production but in the future investments may pay off
 a growing industry is in the growth stage and has high profitability the enterprises of the industry steadily make profits so the volume of production grows
 cyclical industry the return and risk of investments in stocks of companies in this industry depend on the economic cycle phase in general these are industries that produce means of production as well as durable goods
 a seasonal industry is characterized by an irregular output of products due to the season climate and demand for products

the investors task is to identify the most promising sector of the economy and invest accordingly in the shares of the companies the higher the liquidity of a stock the faster an investor can get income if the liquidity of the financial asset is low then it is more difficult to sell or buy shares vice versa for the convenience of analysis stock indices are used as a rule this type of indicator is calculated for the most significant sectors of the economy for example the sp  information technology for evaluating the information technology sector

step   analysis of the company and securities

assessing the value of a company an investor studies profit dividends growth rates the ratio of debt and equity capital also free cash flow is calculated the return on equity is analyzed and the companys growth rates are predicted moreover the companys activities its reputation technologies used in production as well as company management are examined all financial indicators of the company are compared with those of competitors as well as with the industry averages

there are two types of company values which most often dont coincide these are book and market values the last one is conditioned by the ratio of supply and demand the most attractive for investors is the situation when the market value of the company is lower than the book value or the real value of the assets then the companys shares can be considered undervalued in this case investors expect that the share price will rise as it will tend to the book price

in the book analysis of securities by graham and dodd which we mentioned in the first part of the article the following idea was formulated the value of a share depends on its prospects in the future

furthermore we will consider the financial ratios in more detail since companies represented on the stock market are from different industries with different scales of activity different reputations its rather difficult to compare them with each other 

the financial ratios simplify the life of investors as they allow using a single scale not only to determine the real state of affairs of a particular company but also to compare its financial performance with others

here are the most popular multipliers

 p  e capitalization to net profit ratio allows us to calculate how many years it will take for an investment to pay off while maintaining the current profit of the company the ratio was proposed by graham and dodd as an estimate of the fair value of the shares the value of the indicator is usually in the range of  to  the indicator below the range indicates the undervaluation of the companys shares and attracts investors
 p  s capitalization to revenue ratio shows how much the investor pays per unit of revenue a coefficient value less than  is okay a value less than  indicates underestimation
 p  bv the ratio of capitalization to the companys capital the ratio of the market price of a share to the value of assets per share  makes it clear what the investor will get in case of bankruptcy of the company a value greater than one indicates that if the company goes bankrupt then there will not be enough funds to pay off debts for all shareholders a value less than one on the contrary shows that in case of bankruptcy all shareholders will be paid their shares
 Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) capitalization of the company  debt liabilities  available cash is the fair value of the company
 Eaton Vance Corporation (EV)  ebitda the ratio of the companys value to pretax profit shows the period of time for the unspent depreciation interest and taxes the profit of the company to pay off the cost of acquiring the company the multiplier is similar to the p  e but more reliable for comparing companies the evaluation procedure is the same the lower the value the better
 eps the ratio of net income to the number of common shares the growth eps rate is used for the analysis the percentage of the current indicator to the past often a sharp decline or rise in profits will cause a stock price movement 
 roe net profit to equity  shows how much profit a unit of equity capital brings thereby you can judge the efficiency of the company

thus fundamental analysis is based on the study of macroeconomic indicators sectors in order to choose the most promising option the state of an individual company and on the study of securities separately

novice investors need to clearly distinguish between market and book value of assets its usually better to buy those assets that are currently undervalued by the market since they are likely to rise in price you can choose a company using financial ratios that allow you not only to assess the state of the company but also to compare it with competitors soon moninvai will add additional fundamental analysis indicators for even more accurate forecasts",14,nan,nan,nan
Fundamental analysis,EducatedInvesting,Facebook: A Bullish Analysis [Mostly Fundamental with some Technical],"video summary of the below 

 price



facebook currently trades at around  its latest support is at around  to  and its latest resistance is actually around  so essentially the price that its trading for right now this is a crucial moment if it manages to break  then we can see an upward movement going up to  which is the high ceiling of this channel that it has started forming if you havent invested yet it could be a good time to wait for a couple of days or a week to see how its price will evolve i have a feeling that it will start consolidating or it could slowly drop down to  or worst case scenario  it is currently trading above its d ma and its relative strength index is near the top but the volume is relatively low which makes me think that we probably wont see a lot of movement in the next week or two however as i said i think that there is a good chance that we can see facebook hitting  in a few months and maybe even  by the end of the year why well facebook has been delivering great results after great results the fundamental performance of the company has been amazing so far absolutely amazing in fact out of all of its  earnings reports since  it has only missed  and that was by  cent and it has only missed revenue twice the company outperforms analyst expectations and by a big margin especially in the last  quarters last quarter it beat analyst earnings expectations by  this is massive especially for a company of facebooks size essentially what we are seeing is the pandemic boost in advertising that facebook received was not as transitory as analysts expected also there has been nothing but upward revisions for facebooks full year  earnings which is a very good sign  upward revisions in total there have also been  upward earnings revisions for next quarters earnings which is almost always a good sign also out of the  analyst covering facebook in may  have had a buy or a strong buy rating

 the business

however lets leave analyst opinions aside for the moment they are good to gauge wall streets appetite for the company but lets look at the business at the fundamentals is facebook really a good company facebooks main source of revenue are the advertising revenues that come from Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS) on its products the facebook app and website instagram whatsapp and messenger by gathering user data facebook is able to offer targeted Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS) which are obviously more expensive but are also more attractive to advertisers even though regulators have reduced the amount of data that facebook can gather and therefore reduced its ability to target specific audiences through its Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS) the company has still managed to grow its advertising business by a lot another reason why the company has done so well is because it operates the th most website in the world facebook which is also the nd most visited social media website behind youtube instagram is extremely popular as well ranking in the rd place as of the latest quarter the daily active users of facebooks family of products are  billion with the number of monthly active users being  billion or more than  times the population of the us this is literally half of the worlds population facebook is still seeing growth in user numbers with its total user base up  yearonyear which is actually faster than last years increase of  so we can see that their user base is growing but is that translating into higher revenues the answer yes in  facebook reported a  yearonyear advertising revenue increase but in their last quarter alone the advertising revenue increase was  compared to last year advertising makes about  of facebooks revenue so we can see that the company is getting a serious boost in overall profits their net income also grew by  in  yearonyear and an astonishing  in the first quarter of  as compared to last year essentially we can see that facebook is reporting some serious growth for a megacap company and it is largely due to the increase in their advertising business however facebook are also involved in virtual and augmented reality through their reality labs while this side of facebook is still tiny it is reporting a serious growth in revenues as well in the first quarter of  its revenue grew by almost  as compared to last year and now makes up  of facebooks revenue vr and ar are still relatively young industries but they are growing fast as we can see market researchers claim that the industry will grow at an annual rate of  from b in  to an astonishing t in  facebook is one of the leaders in this space along with apple microsoft and samsung so this represents a massive opportunity for the tech giant and yet another solid bullish argument for facebook unlike its competitors facebooks business is relatively concentrated so i think this gives the company a competitive advantage when it comes to growing its vr and ar business the company has also grown its headcount by  in  so we can see that it is doubling down on expansion and growth despite that analysts are only expecting a revenue and earnings growth of about  annually for the next  years to some extent that is justified as facebook did get a big bump in earnings due to covid however i think that their estimates lean towards the conservative side and i think that facebook can actually achieve a growth of between  and  especially when we consider the vr and ar business this may sound optimistic but given facebooks record of beating analyst estimates i am okay with sounding optimistic the only hurdle that facebook may run into is regulation which is always on the table for big tech companies like it however it has has a record of successfully dealing with regulation and continuing to deliver good results despite of it so ill take my chances

 the balance sheet

now you may be thinking great facebook is positioned well for the future but how are the fundamentals looking right now we can see they are growing but can they support that growth personally i think so facebook has a tremendous balance sheet and a massive stockpile of cash and cash equivalents they currently have just over b as of th march  which represents a b increase from the end of december  and an increase of almost b since december  the huge cash positions means that facebook has enough capital to expand without being worried about financing it means that it can buy new companies to help its expansion or to prevent competition but most importantly it means that the company is doing well we can also see that in the companys share repurchase program facebook has repurchased b of shares in  and b of shares in  and in january  it authorized an additional b of stock repurchases so the total right now is about b this doesnt mean that they will repurchase all b but that they can still the fact that they have authorized that programme is a positive sign in addition to their massive stockpile of cash facebook only has liabilities of b or less than half the size of its cash stockpile what does that mean it means that facebook is healthy and its taking its vitamins the company is solid and is more than able to tackle any short or mediumterm challenges to its business it has no longterm debt meaning that if they do decide to borrow money they will be able to do so at much better rates than some of its rivals

 the ratios

then if we look at some the fundamental ratios we can see that facebook is a beast their returnonassets is  compared to the industrys average of  and their returnonequity was  last year lets compare it to its rivals i think that the companies closest to facebook in terms of business are twitter google and snapchat although snap is in very early stages of growth in terms of roa and roe both snapchat and twitter are negative so theres not much point in comparing them but google has a  roa their roe is also lower at  as opposed to facebooks  now facebooks forward pricetoearnings ration is only  whereas google has  twitters is  and snapchat has a forward pe of  so again facebook turns out to be the best price for its projected earnings in terms of current pe facebook has  google has  and snapchat and twitter dont have one because they are unprofitable the current sp average pe is  so we can see that both facebook and google are under the market average although facebook is again cheaper what these ratios tell us is that facebook is not only operating a very efficient business but its also at a very good price relative to its peers even looking at it historically facebook has rarely dropped below a pe of  so the current price is again excellent and cheap this is my own opinion feel free to do your own research but according to my personal eps growth we can expect a roughly  annual return on facebook over the next  years if we buy it at  that is assuming a  earnings growth next year which will taper off and assuming that we can sell it at a pe ratio of around  if the earnings grow at around  next year then we can look at a roughly  annual return which is higher than the average return of the sp  meaning that facebook is likely to beat the market at least in my opinion

 tdlr

facebook is

 showing growth in userbase especially in emerging markets
 showing huge growth in the ar and vr business which is overlooked by most analysts but is an amazing longterm opportunity
 healthy as hell  no debt more than  times cash and cash equivalents than liabilities
 the cheapest out of the faang stocks and actually the majority of the market
 potentially reaching  by the end of the year although it may dip to  or worst case scenario

investment strategies can be placed into one of four primary categories however its worth noting that some investors like to use a combination to meet their investment objectives

  passive income

a passive income strategy is also known as  this is where investors seek to generate an additional income stream using the stock market as such they often gravitate toward businesses that offer a chunky and reliable dividend

various financial metrics can give insight into whether a company can maintain their dividends such as the dividend yield and payout ratio however a common shortcut investors can use is to simply look at the 

these are the dividend stocks that have raised shareholder payouts each year for at least  years and some investors like to take this one step further by only looking at dividend kings  stocks that have paid an increasing dividend for more than  years in a row

outside the realm of the stock market fixedincome debt instruments like  are also a popular asset class that passive income investors often explore

  capital appreciation

a capital appreciation strategy where  and value investing come into play this is where investors seek to grow their investment portfolio by buying low and selling high in other words their focus is on finding a business whose stock price has the potential to surge as such they often focus on shares with impressive sales and earnings growth rates

investing in a growth stock opens the door to potentially explosive performance but that comes at the added cost of risk these shares are significantly more volatile often falling by double digits when investor expectations arent met or when economic conditions worsen

investing in value stocks can be equally daunting while identifying an undervalued business can be a lucrative longterm investment it can sometimes take a long time for the stock market to reflect the true value of a company for investors without sufficient patience even a correct analysis may result in a poorperforming investment

  wealth preservation

not every investor is seeking to build wealth some are already fortunate enough to be rich and are seeking a way to preserve their wealth this usually means sticking to lowvolatility stocks of mature enterprises in a highly diversified portfolio spanning multiple industries and geographies

there are also several alternative investment instruments commonly held by wealthpreserving investors the list typically includes  etfs commodities like gold and government bonds

  speculation

investors with a high tolerance for extreme risk can sometimes deploy a speculative investment strategy this often boils down to investing in a   or leveraged etf these are tiny businesses with enormous upside potential yet even the most promising startup can fail to deliver and the vast majority end up crashing to zero

thats why many associates the speculation strategy with gambling rather than investing and investors interested in executing this strategy should be prepared to potentially lose everything

 how to analyse stocks

in their famous book  security analysis  benjamin graham and david l dodd described stock analysis as the careful study of available facts with the attempt to draw conclusions therefrom based on established principles and sound logic

the whole purpose of researching and analysing stocks is to help investors make more informed decisions and today a wealth of information is readily available from websites financial media regulatory filings and stock research services like our 

there are two primary methods of stock analysis

 fundamental analysis  this involves analysing a company to determine its intrinsic value and future potential the investor seeks to understand the business model the industry it operates in financial standing operating efficiency management team as well as other businessspecific factors
 technical analysis  this involves analysing trends and patterns in the share price movements of a stock using these technical indicators the individual investor can make a prediction of whats coming in the next hour day week or even month its the method of choice for shortterm traders attempting to profit from the mood and momentum of the stock market rather than the underlying fundamentals of a business

there are also two approaches used when deciding which stocks are worth analysing in the first place

 topdown analysis  this is arguably the most common approach used by investors and involves using a stock screener to identify opportunities instead of looking at companies straight away an analyst first looks at the state of the economy from there they determine which industries have the most potential before deciding which subsectors in these industries are looking promising the analyst then applies fundamental or technical analysis on the pool of companies within the selected subsector to pick the bestlooking investments
 bottomup analysis  with this approach investors start by analysing companies directly either based on fundamental or technical metrics the businesses are then compared to their parent subsectors and industries to determine whether they are a good pick this approach can often be more timeconsuming than topdown due to the lack of initial screening however it also highlights which stocks to avoid as well as potential winners

when learning how to pick stocks its often recommended that investors explore each strategy and use the one that they feel most comfortable with

 what are the main factors to consider when picking stocks

beyond identifying which businesses are the best stocks to buy investors must also consider their personal circumstances

 investment goals  does the stock align with the investors investment goals highgrowth shares are likely unsuitable in a portfolio designed to preserve wealth
 time horizon  does the investment thesis surrounding a stock match the investors time horizon investing in a business that needs a decade to deliver on its mission is likely unsuitable for an investor seeking to withdraw their capital within the next five years
 risk tolerance  is the stock too volatile for an investor to sleep well at night investors who have a lowrisk tolerance are likely illsuited to own risky penny stocks
 personal values  does the stock meet the investors ethical and moral requirements with  becoming more popular some investors are boycotting companies operating in the tobacco gambling and arms dealing industries

 stock portfolio management

beyond learning how to pick stocks investors also need to learn how to manage their  portfolio management is a critical step on an investing journey and when combined with skilled stock picking can unlock substantial returns while keeping risk in check

there are two primary ways investors can manage their portfolios each with its own advantages and disadvantages

  active investing

 entails the constant buying and selling of stocks or investments to achieve higher returns in picking stocks an investor aims to buy stocks low and sell them high moving in and out of the market frequently

advantages

 can achieve marketbeating investment returns
 offers greater control over which stocks an investor owns building an investment portfolio that reflects their goals risk tolerance and moral values

disadvantages

 more frequent transactions result in higher trading costs
 requires highquality research and analysis that an investor may not have the expertise to execute hiring an  can overcome this problem but these professionals can be expensive

  passive investing

 entails money being invested solely in  and not actively checking their performance this strategy suits investors who want to put their portfolio on autopilot matching the returns of a benchmark index like the ftse  or the sp 

advantages

 matches the stock markets performance with little to no research or stock analysis required
 requires fewer transactions reducing annual trading fees

disadvantages

 investors have limited control over which stocks they own with morally objectionable shares such as gambling tobacco and arms dealing businesses being blended into the mix
 impossible to achieve marketbeating returns

this style of investing is becoming increasingly popular thanks to its simplicity and decent returns by comparison most active investors fail to beat the stock market mainly due to a lack of skill and emotional discipline

 who are the most famous stock pickers

 warren buffett  considered by many as one of the greatest investors of all time picking highquality stocks that are trading below their intrinsic value and holding them for decades
 charlie munger  warren buffetts righthand man serving as a friend and fellow stock picker at berkshire hathaway

 george soros  considered to be one of the greatest hedge fund managers of all time soros fund management has delivered investors with a  average annualised return for more than  years

 alternatives to stock picking

becoming a stock picker is not an easy task and requires a lot of time dedication and skill while investors can pay for a research service or hire an analyst to take care of the research process they may still fail to achieve marketbeating returns if they lack emotional discipline

investing in an individual stock can be a volatile experience that many investors arent able to stomach fortunately there are alternative methods of investing in the stock market that doesnt require investors to learn how to pick stocks

 index funds  these funds track the performance of a stock market index by buying an index fund an investor can match the performance of an underlying benchmark index without having to research any stocks
 exchangetraded funds  these funds provide a lowcost method of tracking indices sectors commodities and currencies with a professional investment manager making all the decisions on behalf of shareholders
 mutual funds  these funds can deploy active as well as passive investing strategies and provide a route for investors to potentially outperform the stock market without having to pick individual stocks themselves
 roboadvisers  investors fill out a questionnaire designed to determine their time horizon risk tolerance and investment objectives based on the responses an automated trading algorithm will invest an investors capital on their behalf in appropriate asset classes and investment vehicles

 the bottom line

learning how to pick stocks can be a daunting process there are a lot of moving parts to consider which require time and effort that not everyone has to spare however for those determined to find winning investments picking stocks is a proven path to marketbeating returns

 

the stock market is reeling from the growing level of inflation and with so many fantastic businesses trading at massive discounts now could be the perfect time for savvy investors to snatch up some potential bargains

Technical analysis,EducatedInvesting,"Innovative technical analysis: Automated Trading, Trading Robots","algorithmic also called automated trading is the conduct of purchase and sale operations in financial markets using specialized programs  trading robots 

the tasks of trading robots are to analyze prices according to specified algorithms to make decisions and as a result to perform trading operations on the market  
robot trading is widely used in the markets and its share relative to manual transactions is only growing a computer program has many advantages

 does not get tired
 stressfree
 strictly follows the algorithm
 reacts significantly faster to changes in the market

roboadvisors

among the programs for automated trading two broad categories can be distinguished trading robots and indicators the first ones are intended for performing trading operations in the markets and the second ones  for analyzing quotes and identifying the change of patterns   
a trading robot or roboadvisor is a program capable of performing any actions at the request of an investor without his direct participation

the disadvantages of roboadvisors include the following

 almost all highquality profitable trading robots cost money the cost of a trading robot on average ranges from  to 
  of free advisors that can be found on the net deserve attention only as examples samples for new ideas but not fullfledged automated trading systems
 it is believed that with all its advantages an advisor will never completely replace a living human trader only a trader can see and take into account some of the details that are hidden from the bot machine the bot will always trade according to a given pattern emotional stress still remains since transactions take place on money there is no getting away from this you can only change your attitude and treat this fact more calmly
 you need a dedicated server vps vps for automated trading it is quite cheap    per month
 the market changes over time which implies the adaptation of the advisor trading algorithm but not every roboadvisor can be optimized
 most of trading robots use martingale that means an increase in the rate transaction volume after a loss this approach carries high risks of losing the deposit

creation of a trading robot

trading robots are written in the mql programming language it allows you to program easily an investment system that will invest online for programmers who are familiar with this language such work will not be difficult for ordinary users this will be a more difficult task therefore many decide to buy their own advisor  
all advisors are recognized as unique programs due to the applied neural network technology since the software collects and analyzes data adapting to the external market environment it can be mentioned that the program does not have a specific strategy but acts like a living person the robot is constantly studying the market and looking for matches with profitable entry points that have already worked well in fact the assistant adjusts the existing algorithm to the required patterns and acts according to the situation  
all advisors have one definite disadvantage if their stuffing is not adjusted from time to time in accordance with the market the information begins to slowly but surely become outdated the result will be wrong decisions unprofitable transactions and zeroing of the deposit balance therefore it is useless to test the robots efficiency on old quotes  
there are a lot of trading robots on the internet but it is very difficult to find a profitable one and if you apply lots of them then there is a great risk of being left without money thats why it is better not to buy an advisor without researching it consider also the fact that many advisors can demonstrate excellent results when testing on one pair of currencies but poorly on others therefore it is better to use the advisor on the instruments on which it was tested  
advisors are based on various technical analysis tools the most popular and successful ones are based on the martingale strategy trading with moving averages bollinger bands and a grid

martingale strategy in trading

the basis of the phenomenon is the principle of doubling the trade size every time a loss is faced literally the term means  to play in an absurd manner judging by the meaning it is understood that the method is related to highspeed and highprofit trading strategies precisely because of this it is used a lot by newcomers who come to the trade with small amount of money

when the market turns against you all that needs to be done is just wait but to wait for a pleasant trend you need to have not only patience but also a sufficient amount of money the deeper the loss is the more it is necessary to open additional positions it seems that the trader is trying to reverse the movement of the price  spends a lot of energy and money on it therefore when the market is finally turning to his side the trader has a regular volume of open positions which will allow hi to compensate for all the losses and he will win a lot this is the martingale method  
the most successful advisors based on this strategy are forever hacked pro forever warrior ea unimillion

moving average trading

a moving average is a technical indicator used to display the average value of an asset over a given period it is an indicator based on past values such as high low open or close or even trading volume so trading strategies can be very diverse  
an example of advisors is ultron

bollinger bands trading

bollinger bands are one of the most popular technical analysis tools used in the modern trading environment bollinger bands are a chart with price channels that reflect a range of volatility within this range the price of a stock can rise or fall  
when using bollinger bands the lower and upper bands are often identified as price targets in this case you buy when the price reaches the lower band and exit when the price reaches the moving average in the center of the bands other traders prefer to sell when the price falls below the lower band or buy when the price breaks above the upper band  
milky way million dollar pips are examples of such advisors

grid trading

this method is very common among novice traders as it does not require special knowledge regarding the foreign exchange market and even such common things as technical or fundamental analysis but a successful grid strategy means knowledge of the main trend at a selected time interval  up down or lateral price movement with a periodic return to the average value  
this method allows you to place orders at specified intervals in a specific price range during grid trading orders are placed above and below the set price creating a grid of orders with gradually increasing and decreasing prices as a result a trading grid is created for example a trader can place buy orders every  below the bitcoin market price and also place sell orders every  above its market price this allows you to benefit from trading under various conditions  
grid trading is ideal for use in volatile and sideways markets when prices fluctuate within a given range this trading method allows you to make a profit with small price changes the more frequent the grid the more often trades will be made

examples of grid roboadvisors are pionex bitsgap kucoin

thus even if it is difficult for you to entrust your funds to a computer program you can set up the advisor to generate sound alerts which will greatly facilitate the work and allow you to spend less time on graphical analysis and waiting for signals to open or close positions

automatic trading is an example of new trends in trading however using only one tool in market analysis is unwise therefore traders most often use different types of technical and fundamental analysis tools together an example of the use of technical analysis and on its basis the introduction of artificial intelligence is moninvai which predicts the values of stocks and cryptocurrencies for the future period",2,nan,nan,nan

Technical analysis,EducatedInvesting,Technical analysis: Types of trends and Japanese candlestick chart,"in the first part of the article we studied the basic principles of technical analysis and began to get acquainted with the price chart now we will pay even more attention to charts and technical indicators

a price chart is a stream of data on exchange transactions it looks like a changing over time line the points of the line are a reflection of information about the price and time of transactions

the chart has a linear form and is tick according to the time interval of construction this graph shows each price change tick chart is a chart that is formed not by time but by deals that is when a deal is carried out a tick is formed

however due to the huge amount of data the tick chart is not easy to analyze therefore in order to optimize graphical analysis the data on the chart is displayed in accordance with the selected time interval or timeframe 

types of trends

as you could already understand the direction of the price is formed by the market participants one of the tasks of technical analysis is to determine the trend of this direction

an uptrend is characterized by a sequence of upward highs this means that each local high maximum is higher than the previous one the same situation is with the local lows minima of the growing trend  they are ascending

the inability of the market to overcome the previous high indicates a weakening of the trend and is an early warning of its reversal any drop below the previous minimum signals a reversal and the beginning of a downward trend

if the growing trend failed to become higher than the previous high but there was no closing below the previous low we can say that the market is entering a sideways movement

local highs and lows of the falling trend form a downward trend the inability of the market to close below the previous low and then a successful attempt to overcome the previous high indicates a reversal of the downward trend

by analogy with an uptrend if the market closes above the previous low but cannot overcome the previous high the market enters the trading range and the downtrend is replaced by a flat

japanese candlestick chart

a regular line chart for a certain timeframe will contain information only about the closing price to display a larger amount of data another type of graphical interpretation of data is used  japanese candlestick charts this type is the most informative

a japanese candlestick represents a change in the price of an asset over a certain time period it contains information about the opening closing maximum and minimum prices 

the japanese candlesticks look like this the low and high are connected by a vertical line a rectangle is built between the opening and closing prices this rectangle will be colored in one of two colors depending on whether the candle was growing white green or falling black red

the candlestick consists of a body and shadows tails the body of the candlestick is a rectangle connecting the opening and closing prices the shadow or tail is that vertical line between the body and the low or high

there are three types of japanese candlesticks

 rising  if the opening price is lower than the closing price
 falling  if the opening price is higher than the closing price
 doji  if the opening and closing prices are the same or close

what conclusions can be drawn from the shapes and sizes of candlesticks

by the size of the candlestick body you can draw conclusions about how strong sellers and buyers are the height of a growing candlestick indicates the number of buyers in the market that is the higher it is the more buyers there are and vice versa the lower the falling candlestick the more those who sell 

the shadows of candlestick can be a signal of loss of strength in the market of sellers or buyers lets consider the following example there was a growth of a candlestick however by the time of the closing of the market it had fallen and left a large shadow on top that is the market was immediately controlled by buyers but by the close there were more sellers and the price fell

thus japanese candlesticks help to display the price movement on the chart however using only this tool when analyzing the market is unwise since candlesticks can give false signals therefore traders most often use different types of technical and fundamental analysis tools together an example of the use of technical analysis and the introduction of artificial intelligence based on it is moninvai which predicts the values of stocks and cryptocurrencies for the future period",4,nan,nan,nan

Technical analysis,EducatedInvesting,"Introduction to technical analysis: Basic principles, Dow Theory, Price chart","technical analysis is the study of the past price to predict the price in the future meanwhile various tools are used indicators graphical figures etc technical analysis does not search for the reason for price changes but predicts the most possible change based on information for the previous period

technical analysis is used by both investors and traders an investor can rely only on fundamental analysis about which we wrote earlier but at the same time use technical analysis in order to acquire an asset at the most favorable price

basic principles of technical analysis

 the price takes into account everything all factors influencing the price have already been taken into account by the market and are reflected in the price this fact means that from the chart of the price and trading volume you can get all the information necessary for making a trading decision
 price movement is dependent on trends the market is prone to the formation of certain trends that have a certain duration the trend can be either growing or falling the rise or fall depends on the balance of supply and demand situations opposite to the trend may also arise they are called corrections also a flat situation when there is no trend can arise in the market it looks like a horizontal price movement
 history tends to repeat the price in the past has been subject to certain changes in certain situations which means that in the future in similar situations the price the ratio of supply and demand that is the behavior of people in the market is likely to react in a similar way

the price chart is the best indicator of how the market is performing it is a timevarying line each point of which reflects information about the price and time of a transaction data on prices and trading volume are displayed on the chart based on the selected time interval  timeframe for example if the hourly timeframe is selected the step on the horizontal axis will be equal to one hour

the graph displays  main indicators corresponding to a certain period of time

 opening price is the price at which trading starts
 closing price is the price of the last deal
 maximum price is the highest transaction price for a certain period of time
 minimum price is the lowest transaction price for a certain period of time
 trading volume is the number of transactions for a certain period of time

the most important of these indicators is the closing price as it reflects the bottom line between buyers and sellers 

dow theory

technical analysis has its origins in a series of articles by charles doe founder of the wall street journal published in the late th century this theory is considered as an attempt to describe the actions of a person and his psychology through charts and mathematical indicators lets look at the basic principles of dow theory

 trends depending on their duration can be divided into three types

 primary longterm valid for a year or more

 secondary mediumterm or secondary fixing movements against the movement of the main market trend

 small shortterm

moreover all three types of trends can be both growing and falling according to dow theory in an uptrend the position of each subsequent peak or decline must be higher than the previous one in a situation with downtrends everything should be exactly the opposite

 the longterm trend is characterized by three phases

the first is the accumulation phase

experienced investors buy or sell stocks during this phase despite the general market behavior this phase is preceded by an opposite trend this stage does not last long and is not accompanied by strong price changes

the second is the participation phase

at the beginning of this phase the socalled active traders with the help of technical analysis catch the beginning of the trend which was begun by investors with large capital when making deals active traders strengthen the trend which is accompanied by a strong price change

the third is the implementation phase

at the last stage all market participants are aware of the current trend thus at the beginning of this phase some traders open positions in the direction of the trend when traders assume the end of the trend they close their positions at a profit

 the trend must be confirmed by the trading volume

trading volume is a required indicator of the existence of a trend if the price changes along with a small trading volume then the trend is absent since it does not reflect the opinion of the majority

 the trend is valid until there is a clear signal of its reversal closure

the market itself shows the moment of reversal or closure this must be checked

the main function of technical analysis according to charles doe is to select the safest and most optimal moments in order to open a deal and make money on speculation on the stock exchange in the long term

thus in this article we got acquainted with the concept of technical analysis and made the main conclusions for ourselves

 the market is the reaction of its participants that is it is like an alive mechanism
 on the charts we see the market balance of supply and demand
 technical analysis predicts the most likely change however in order to succeed you need to use the entire arsenal of tools

an example of the use of technical analysis and on its basis the implementation of artificial intelligence is moninvai which predicts the values of stocks and cryptocurrencies for the future period",1,nan,nan,nan

Risk management,EducatedInvesting,"(Guide) What Is Investment Risk, and How Can Investors Manage It?","investment risk is the probability of a position delivering lowerthanexpected returns through risk management investors can achieve superior returns 



every investment carries risk and generally speaking the more risk an investor is willing to take the higher the potential reward and vice versa understanding the investment risk associated with each decision is critical for successful longterm investing failing to do this will likely destroy wealth rather than create it

with that said lets explore exactly what risks are associated with investing the different types and how to manage them within a portfolio

 what is investment risk

investment risk or financial risk is the probability that an investor will achieve lessthanexpected returns if an investment goes particularly badly a loss may even be incurred and it can stem from any security including

 stocks
 bonds
 real estate
 derivatives
 and in sporadic cases even savings

the reality is no investment is without risk even the highestrated corporate or even government bond can still default thats why financial advisers recommend never investing money that an individual cant afford to lose

however investors aware of the threats their portfolio faces can plan ahead therefore it becomes possible to mitigate the impact of potential risks coming to pass

 types of investment risk

the primary types of financial risks investors have to navigate are

 firmspecific risk  refers to any threat specific to a company such as a revenue stream dependent on only a handful of customers these risks can also be industryspecific for example a mining company could have operations significantly disrupted if there is a cavein any factor that isnt considered to be a firmspecific risk is often classified as systematic risk or market risk
 economic risk  an economy suffering a slowdown or a recession can be a challenging environment for businesses to operate in
 interest rate risk  this is the probability of interest rates being hiked by central banks like the bank of england or the federal reserve increases in interest rates raise the cost of borrowing money placing pressure on profit margins as well as the financial health of a business interest rate risk is also closely tied to inflation risk as the two entities often move in conjunction
 political risk  principally caused by a change in government which may result in changes business decisions made based on the previous governments policy are affected
 counterparty risk  the probability that another party in an agreement contract credit investment or trading transaction may not keep their word leading to a significant loss
 liquidity risk  when referring to a business liquidity risk is the potential that the firm will have insufficient financial resources to meet its shortterm obligations on time when referring to a security liquidity risk is the potential for being unable to sell the security in the future as there are no buyers
 concentration risk  investors who keep a large portion of their investment portfolio within a single asset sector or country are exposed to concentration risk if something were to go wrong and the value of these investments refers to the risk associated with having ones portfolio in a single asset sector or country
 credit  default risk  this is the risk that a borrower will default in making a necessary payment on a debt to a lender this risk typically only applies to financial institutions however in practice any business that lends money is exposed to credit risk
 reinvestment risk  refers to the possibility of being unable to reinvest cash flow from a maturing investment at a similar rate of return
 horizon risk  this is the risk that an investors  and investment strategy may not match sometimes it could be cut short due to job loss or other emergencies
 longevity risk  this is the risk that an individual may live longer than expected resulting in insufficient funds to maintain a desired lifestyle
 foreign investment risk  refers to the risks involved with international markets such as foreign policy or fluctuating currency exchange rates the latter is also often referred to as currency risk

 what are riskfree investments

the term riskfree investment is used to describe a group of securities that have extremely low probabilities of failing investors often use them to reduce the total risk associated with an investment portfolio through diversification

typically the securities within this category include

 government bonds
 treasury bills
 uk gilts
 certificates of deposits
 savings

despite the name even these securities still carry a level of risk governments can default on their loans and banks can go bankrupt even savings protected by depositor insurance can disappear if the amount stored in a bank account exceeds the insurance threshold of 

 risk vs reward

as previously mentioned there is generally a tradeoff between risk and reward in most cases the higher the risk associated with an investment the higher the potential return this is why securities such as  and  are still immensely popular despite having highrisk profiles

everyone has a different tolerance for investment risk as such investment strategies need to reflect this  and keep a portfolio balanced in the context of the individual investor

 how to measure investment risk

despite being a critical piece in the world of investing measuring risk can be tricky most quantitative methods used by professionals today are measures of asset price volatility while this can provide helpful and actionable insight its far from perfect especially for thinly traded asset classes

for example a rare collectable may have a relatively stable price thus low volatility but finding an interested buyer could be challenging

nevertheless the most popular methods of measuring riskvolatility include the following

 standard deviation  this tool measures the historical volatility of an investment compared to its annual return it shows how stable an asset could be less stable investments are known to have higher risks subsequently  typically have a higher standard deviation than stable 
 sharpe ratio  this metric measures the balance between risk and expected return on an investment or portfolio the higher the value the better
 beta  measures the degree to how closely an asset price will move in relation to a stock market index a value of  means the security will match the performance of the market a value of  means that every time the market increases by  the security will increase by  and vice versa beta values can also be negative indicating that the security will move in the opposite direction of the market
 value at risk Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR)  measures the level of risk an investment a company or portfolio is exposed to through this tool a company could measure the maximum loss it could have

 how to manage investment risk

risk management is vital to every successful investment no wonder warren buffetts investment rules are

 never lose money
 never forget rule 

an investor must know how to manage investment risks within their portfolio fortunately there are various methods where that can be achieved

 diversification  this is arguably one of the most popular and arguably most potent risk management strategies within an investors toolkit for stocks the idea is to own various highquality businesses across multiple industries and geographies that way should one position suffer a loss the impact on the overall portfolio is mitigated by the other uncorrelated investments
 pound cost averaging  during periods of stock market volatility spreading buying activity over several weeks and months can mitigate the risk of suffering large unexpected downturns it also ensures that capital remains available to capitalise on any adverse movements to bolster a position in a highquality asset caught in the crossfire
 invest long term  in the long term the stock market generally appreciates in value obviously not every stock can deliver positive returns however by focusing on the long run investors can largely ignore shortterm risks and perhaps even capitalise on the volatility they create
 options  derivatives  as an investor seeks to diversify portfolios options and derivatives could be used as part of a hedging strategy however options and derivatives require skill and expertise to use correctly a novice investor with limited knowledge of financial derivatives can potentially suffer enormous losses far greater than the initial amount invested thats why these securities are typically reserved for professionals

 the bottom line

investment risks are intrinsic to every form of investment however the risk levels differ from investment to investment while risk cannot be avoided entirely it can be minimised and by implementing proper risk management tools investors can potentially reap significant returns while keeping risk in check

 

the stock market is reeling from the growing level of inflation and with so many fantastic businesses trading at massive discounts now could be the perfect time for savvy investors to snatch up some potential bargains

deciding which stocks to add to a shopping list during times like these can be daunting for new and seasoned investors

Risk management,EducatedInvesting,(Guide) Passive Investing Strategies: A Beginner’s Guide,"passive investing strategies allow investors to build wealth over time with minimal effort discover the pros and cons of this approach 



passive investing strategies seek to maximise investment returns by trading as little as possible instead of actively buying and selling securities passive investors adopt a buyandhold approach and for those not interested in learning  for the long term  is one of the most popular passive investing strategies

 characteristics of passive investing strategies

at the heart of every passive investing strategy lies the  of building wealth steadily over time while ignoring shortterm opportunities there are some differences between the various methods available however some common characteristics across all forms include

 longterm outlook  passive investors seek to capitalise on the longterm upward trend of the stock market therefore they operate with long 
 diversified portfolio  while the stock market generally trends upward over time not every business survives the journey therefore a portfolio needs to be well diversified to absorb and mitigate the damage of one or more positions failing to meet expectations  are incredibly popular among passive investors since they provide instant diversification within a single transaction
 lower risk profile  while its impossible to eliminate all investment risks the potential adverse impact of firmspecific threats can be mitigated through diversification therefore passive investors are typically exposed to a lower risk profile than active investors
 low costs  the buyandhold philosophy of passive investors results in far fewer transactions versus an active trader as such the amount of money spent on commissions and transaction fees is significantly lower furthermore longterm investments are taxed less than shortterm trades in some countries resulting in additional tax savings
 dividends  while not a requirement stocks popular with passive investors often provide a stream of passive income through dividends

 types of passive investments

several types of securities and tools are available for investors to adopt passive investing strategies

 index fund  as previously mentioned index funds are one of the most popular passive wealthbuilding methodsinvestors can buy shares in a lowcost passive mutual fund or an exchangetraded fund designed to track a particular index in the uk some of the most popular indices include the  and  whereas in the united states the  is often the goto option however there are more focused fund options that track specific sectors or commodities that can cater to different investor risk tolerances
 real estate  investing in rental property can provide a steady monthly income stream however raising capital for this type of investment can be challenging and expensive not to mention dealing with tenants can sometimes require more active involvement fortunately there is a handsoff alternative investors can instead buy shares in a  which invests shareholder capital into real estate and returns the rental income as dividends
 investment adviser  for individuals with a higher net worth hiring an  to manage an investment portfolio is an alternative handsoff approach to building wealth
 roboadviser  for individuals with a lower net worth  are becoming increasingly popular these automated investing algorithms manage an investors assets based on their investment goals and risk tolerance

 advantages of passive investing strategies

while passive investing is often a more boring method of building wealth it does come with some significant advantages

 simple  low effort  the stock market is a complicated wealthbuilding mechanism that can quickly destroy wealth when mistakes are made learning how to pick stocks analyse market trends and forecast future returns requires indepth knowledge that individuals may be unable or unwilling to spend time learning and yet these challenges can be almost entirely bypassed by using a passive strategy letting both novice and experienced investors build wealth without having to provide much oversight or portfolio management
 low cost  as previously mentioned investing passively incurs fewer transactions reducing the investment fees paid each year
 transparent  most passive investing vehicles provide enormous transparency where capital is invested mutual funds disclose which types of securities they invest in what sectors theyre exposed to and how diversified their portfolios are this makes it incredibly easy for investors to know exactly where their money is being allocated and how much risk theyre exposed to
 tax efficient  every country has different tax treatments for capital gains however positions that are held longer than  months are taxed more generously than investments held for shorter periods

 disadvantages of passive investing strategies

as powerful as the advantages of passive investing can be its not without drawbacks

 limited choice  the stock market is home to thousands of publically traded companies however the vast majority are unsuitable for passive investing strategies the same applies to most asset types that cannot be used in a passive portfolio this limits the number of choices a passive investor has when deciding where to invest their money
 limited returns  since passive investors arent actively picking individual stocks the maximum returns an investor can achieve are limited for those investing in an index fund generating the marketbeating returns that picking individual stocks can provide is impossible
 limited control  when investing through passive funds or trusts investors have next to no control over where their money ends up being invested for example buying shares in a ftse  exchangetraded fund is equivalent to indirectly investing in each of the uks top  companies however if there are some specific companies an investor doesnt want to own such as tobacco stocks there is no way to exclude them

 passive vs active investing strategies

the general approach of passive investing strategies is to mirror the stock markets performance by comparison active investing strategies seek to outperform the stock market and achieve higher returns to accelerate the wealthbuilding process

active investors have far more control over their capital but it comes at the cost of effort investors deploying active management strategies must perform all necessary research risk analysis and portfolio management while investors can choose to buy shares in active mutual funds historically these investment vehicles have failed to deliver marketbeating returns after deducting management fees

needless to say active management is a far more timeconsuming process services like  can significantly cut down the research time in the search for topnotch stocks however a passive strategy may be more suitable for investors unable or unwilling to spend time actively managing their investment portfolios

related 

 alternative investing strategies

the stock market is a giant sandbox and there are far more alternative investment strategies that investors can adopt to build wealth investors should spend time researching and exploring each option to find the most suitable strategy for their personal circumstances

 active  investors seek to outperform the stock market by picking individual stocks and capitalising on shortterm trends
 momentum  investors focus on stock price momentum rather than underlying fundamentals decisions are made solely based on price action and trading volume
 value  this investing strategy involves buying securities trading at prices below their estimated intrinsic value
 growth  this investment strategy involves investing in companies industries and sectors that are growing and are expected to grow significantly in the future
 smallcap  focuses on smaller businesses that arent as widely followed by financial institutions this region of the stock market can often be riskier however its also where some terrific undervalued longterm growth opportunities can be discovered
 dividend  investors focus solely on businesses that provide a stable dividend to shareholders to build a portfolio that generates a reliable stream of passive income
 esg  this strategy exclusively considers companies that score highly on environmental and societal responsibility scales as determined by independent firms and research groups
 factor  this investment strategy focuses on assets based on certain characteristics that have been proven to outperform over long time horizons

 should i use a passive investing strategy

passive investing strategies are immensely popular due to their simplicity and handsoff management requirements however that doesnt necessarily make it a suitable option for all investors

passive investing requires a monumental amount of patience and the ability not to panic during  and  the latter is often easier said than done and naturally impatient individuals will likely struggle to build wealth using a passive investing strategy

thats why its important for investors to explore all the available options to decide which one is best for their personal circumstances

 the bottom line

passive investing is beneficial for investors who have a longterm approach it is low cost low effort and provides an easy solution to replicating the stock markets average returns however it also has some drawbacks total gains can be limited and investors often have limited choices and control over their investment portfolios

 

the stock market is reeling from the growing level of inflation and with so many fantastic businesses trading at massive discounts now could be the perfect time for savvy investors to snatch up some potential bargains

deciding which stocks to add to a shopping list during times like these can be daunting for new and seasoned investors

Risk management,EducatedInvesting,"Guide: What is automatic rebalancing, and how does it work?","automatic rebalancing is a relatively new technique in the financial industry to help keep risk in check the value of investments is constantly in a state of flux and over time the balance between stocks bonds and other asset classes within a portfolio can shift drastically

investment strategies often define a strict set of ratios between asset classes these ratios are commonly referred to as target asset allocation

a more aggressive growth portfolio will likely have a higher proportion of stocks to bonds while a conversation approach would be the opposite professionallymanaged investment portfolios are rebalanced regularly and as the name suggests automatic rebalancing automates this process



 what is automatic portfolio rebalancing

automatic rebalancing is offered by many trading platforms and  today using algorithmicallybased software the allocation of different asset classes within a portfolio can be automatically realigned at a specified interval  typically once per year this can be pretty convenient for individuals with limited time or investing knowledge and further helps put investments on autopilot

traditionally portfolio rebalancing is done manually based on recommendations offered by a  but hiring a professional to manage an investment portfolio can be quite expensive roboadvisers on the other hand are a far cheaper alternative and offer automated portfolio rebalancing solutions usually by default

but why is rebalancing important in the first place

it all comes down to risk a conservative investor close to retirement may have a portfolio comprising  stocks and  bonds but after a stock market rally the value of their shares increased drastically thats obviously good news but its also shifted the balance between bonds and stocks

shares now represent  of the overall portfolio resulting in a higher risk profile beyond the limits of the original investment strategy

to rebalance the asset mix and bring risk levels back down the investor can either invest new capital into bonds or take profits from their equity returns and invest the proceeds into bonds the objective is to return the balance back down to the original asset allocation or to a renewed target allocation

through automatic rebalancing this entire process is handled by a computer allowing the investor to focus on other things

 how does this strategy work

when it comes to rebalancing an investment portfolio there are three primary methods available to investors

 manual rebalancing  an investment manager is hired to keep track of the ratio between asset classes in an investment portfolio they design a rebalancing strategy and advise on which positions to divest or bolster in exchange for a fee that typically lies around  of an investors portfolio value per year
 diy rebalancing  an individual investor can decide to rebalance without an investment advisers help and rely on their own research and judgement to make decisions while this avoids paying any fees to a professional it requires skill and emotional discipline that many investors dont possess a badly rebalanced portfolio can significantly underperform over the long term therefore diy investing is typically not recommended for novice investors with nexttono experience
 rebalancing investments  instead of picking individual stocks and bonds investors can invest in a  or  where the fund manager makes all the rebalancing decisions on their behalf for example targetdate funds constantly rebalance to account for an investors age
 automatic rebalancing  the rebalancing decisions are executed based on a trading algorithm automatic rebalancing is usually an optional premium service that charges a small fee proportionate to the size of an investor portfolio typically the charges for this service sit around  of an investors portfolio value per year making it a cheaper alternative to hiring an investment manager

 what are the advantages of automatic rebalancing

while automatic rebalancing may not be suitable for everyone it does offer some noteworthy advantages

 removes emotion  emotions are removed from the equation by keeping the process automatic this prevents the risk of falling into an emotional investing trap and better protects wealth
 maintains diversification  as an asset class grows and shrinks within an investment portfolio diversification can be adversely affected through automatic rebalancing this no longer poses an issue
 stays the course  rebalancing asset allocation ensures an investment strategy remains on track delivering on the  time horizon and risk tolerance of an investor
 no knowledge requirements  investors dont need to know how to rebalance their portfolios manually as a trading algorithm makes all the decisions on their behalf
 investing autopilot  investors dont need to think about rebalancing as the process is completed automatically
 low fees  automatic rebalancing is typically cheaper than hiring an investment adviser to rebalance a portfolio manually

 what are the disadvantages of automatic rebalancing

as advantageous and costeffective as automatic rebalancing may be there are some significant drawbacks for investors to consider

 no human input  all investment decisions are made by a computer typically with nexttono human intervention for investors trying to understand why certain decisions are being made it may be impossible to get an answer by paying for professional help
 no control  beyond some general outlines investors typically have no say in where their capital is reallocated
 contradicts buy  hold investing  buy  hold investors dont typically use aggressive rebalancing techniques as they operate with longer time horizons using automatic rebalancing may result in a position being sold against the investors will
 clips winning investments  a stock that has surged to new heights is likely to be targeted by an automatic rebalancing algorithm as the position becomes a larger chunk of the overall portfolio however its possible that the shares may be set to surge even higher in the long term and by selling shares today the investor misses out on all the additional future growth
 more transaction costs  unlike manual rebalancing automatic rebalancing is a constant process that will activate as soon as a portfolio deviates from the specified target asset allocation during a period of heightened market volatility this can trigger a significantly higher level of transactions resulting in higher commission and trading costs

 the bottom line

the financial markets are constantly moving up and down and this volatility can often cause a portfolio to veer off track automatic rebalancing helps correct this potential portfolio problem reducing risk exposure with minimal effort required by the investor

however rebalancing a portfolio too frequently can quickly rack up additional costs while undermining its longterm performance investors need to weigh the pros and cons before using this type of service or platform feature

 

the stock market is reeling from the growing level of inflation and with so many fantastic businesses trading at massive discounts now could be the perfect time for savvy investors to snatch up some potential bargains

seasonal factors are expected to play a bigger role in the price action of gold resulting in an extremely bullish outlook as gold continues to shine as a strong hedge against economic uncertainty and a safe haven investment source  

boasting a firstclass acquisition that couldnt be created today with less than m according to billionaire mining investor frank giustra west red lake gold mines wrlgv wrlgf is one junior gold company with significant potential

the first round of drill results from the madsen mine were drilled from underground on the north austin zone a new area of highgrade mineralization expanding the resource to the northeast 

sitting adjacent to the existing underground development the zone is a highcaliber target that could potentially be developed early during future mine restart and production as it remains open downdip and along strike to the northeast and will continue to be a priority expansion target as underground drilling continues

we are very encouraged by this first round of results out from the underground drilling campaign at the madsen mine our geologic team quickly recognized the exploration potential in the north austin area which represents a highgrade expansion target that sits very close to existing underground infrastructure while a good portion of the underground drill meters will continue to be focused on definition and increasing confidence in the current resource we will continue to take advantage of nearmine organic growth opportunities that could materially enhance and increase the mineral resource inventory at madsen 

this news follows wrlgs previous significant step forward in derisking its highgrade resource following additional positive metallurgical test results from its rowan mine deposit deeming the rowan deposit to be a future source of highgrade easily recoverable gold ounces that could potentially add a significant boost to the overall production profile at madsen

Economic indicators,EducatedInvesting,"DXY, what is it and why does it matter?","hey all 

last monday i wrote a post on dxy and its increased relevance across the broader market for a different venue and it  has received quite a bit of positive feedback since the dxy bounce i flagged in the original post is now playing out while the broader market comes under some downward pressures spy btc gold so i figured that i would share the post more broadly all of the data below is still relevant as it was generally deduced from high timeframe analysis and indicators on  week candles 

here is an updated read on the day dxy chart 

the rest of the post begins below



i hope everyone is having a fantastic start to the new year i wanted my first post to be orientated towards a macro consideration that i think will continue to stay relevant throughout that brings into focus the title of the post dxy what is it and why does it matter

what is dxy

dxy is the us dollar index and it is an index of the value of the us dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies the basket currencies simply put dxy goes up when the us dollar gains strength relative to the basket currencies and conversely goes down when the us dollar loses strength in comparison to the basket currenciesfor those that are curious the composition and weight of the basket currencies is

 euro eur  weight
 japanese yen jpy  weight
 pound sterling gbp  weight
 canadian dollar cad  weight
 swedish krona sek  weight
 swiss franc chf  weight

my background is in technical analysis so its worth mentioning some of the limitations inherent within dxy for higher timeframe macro analysis

 dxy was created in  so when looking at dxy on very high timeframe candles  year candles quarterly candles not all of the higher exponential moving averages emas and simple moving averages smas will be populated eg you would need  years of price action to get a  ema on a  year candle time frame
 the composition of the basket currencies has only been altered once when the euro was created at the start of  as a result some economists feel that the basket currencies are overdue for an update to more accurately reflect the current state of global economic affairs eg china mexico brazil and south korea are currently not included in the basket currencies

why does dxy matter

dollar strength and rate of inflation have always been a worthwhile consideration when analyzing stocks commodities and other assets but  has brought about a perfect storm of sorts where dxy has become increasingly relevantthe forces that elevated dxy to its heightened relevance are

 extremely low interest rates which encourage greater risk appetites in the search for returns on capital
 inflationary concerns related to the covid and subsequent fiscal stimulus undertaken by congress and the fed
    m has never increased by such a significant percentage

 m background
    m is a measure of the money supply that includes cash checking deposits and easily convertible near money
    m is a broader measure of the money supply than m which just includes cash and checking deposits
    m is closely watched as an indicator of money supply and future inflation and as a target of central bank monetary policy

for example in  during the great recessionfinancial crisis m increased by roughly  in contrast m in  increased by approximately 

 see m chart 

traditionally some of the best hedges against inflation are stocks real estate treasury inflationprotected securities tips and gold and other commodities in essence things that are actively priced and traded in dollars will generally accrue in value as the dollar weakens through inflationin the current economic environment the perfect storm developed because there is an increasing concern that substantial inflation may be beginning to take place this inflationary concern is further compounded by there being very little opportunity for decent returns on risk free money such as fdic insured deposits and treasury bonds the feds general policy is targeting a  rate of inflation however given the current unprecedented monetary environment it is unknown what the sizable increase in m will actually mean for that target rate if the inflationary rate greatly exceeds  institutions and individuals with massive holdings will be left potentially scrambling to figure out where to park all their money in order to hedge against inflationlastly the above concepts regarding dxys relevance to the market is further bolstered when one looks at a correlation coefficient for dxy vs spx and btc

 see dxy correlation coefficient data 

the above shows a correlation coefficient for dxy vs the sp  and btcusd a correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength of the relationship between the relative movements of two assets or variables the values range between  extremely inversely correlated to  extremely correlated therefore a correlation of  shows a perfect negative correlation while a correlation of  shows no linear relationship between the movement of the two assetsthe dxy correlation coefficient data shows that dxy is inversely correlated to the sp  at a measure of  with  being a perfect inverse correlation meanwhile the data shows that dxy is inversely correlated with btcusd at a measure of  surprisingly it would therefore be reasonable to deduce that dxy going down has a higher impact on the sp  going up than even on btcusd increasing in valuesome long term technical analysis on dxyas the  month dxy chart below shows  was a pretty wild year for dxy dxy broke through a multiyear diagonal trendline and then subsequently retested the breakdown area and was rejected thereafter dxy failed to hold above several key horizontal support levels as it continued to weaken into the end of 

 see dxy  month candles chart w relevant trendlines and horizontal supports 

in addition there are further troubling signs for the next year for dxy in that bearish crosses are occurring on relevant exponential moving averages i flagged the  ema and  ema cross while historical volatility percentile is also expanding to the upside however  month stochastics are very low in the range and the negative slope on the rsi has begun to flatten out hinting that dxy may not just plummet to the center of the earth tomorrow

 see dxy  month candles chart w indicators 

on lower time frames from  week to  day the indicators are suggesting that dxy may indeed attempt a short term bounce attempt relevant targets for such a bounce attempt are    and  if the bounce does play out i would expect there to be resulting downward pressure across equities until dxy resumes its downward trajectory a daily close on dxy below the  level would invalidate this short term bounce attempt

 see dxy  day chart w indicators suggesting potential bounce may be coming 

thanks for the read and i hope the above was helpful in learning a bit about dxy and its increased relevance across the broader markets",33,"great post couple of quick commentsquestions 

didnt fed say they are okay with inflation  in order to catch up on years with low inflation if this is true then we are likely to enter a higher inflation environment relative to recent years thoughts

i might be misunderstanding your phrasing for the correlation are you saying the correlation between dxy and spy or btc is the coefficient if dxy goes down  then spy goes up",i learned something new today thank you,nan

Trading strategy,StockMarket,My AI momentum trading journey just started. Dumping $3k into an automated trading strategy guided by ChatGPT. Am I gonna make it,"as a major lurker iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen quite a few of these trading journey posts and i decided that i might as well jump in the fire with my very own take

the weather is just about brewing with enough chaos that we might see a decent tailwind across ai stocks within the next few months i intend to ride the hypecycle with a an automated ai strategy to capture as much upside value as possible

a few things that make me believe the ai hype cycle is just getting started

the fedning

 government expenditure in relation to gdp will continue to increase this isnt just a us phenomena nation states worldwide are increasing government expediture and reachchipps act various ai accessibility and regulatory acts a good portion of this will trickle down into the market cap of bluechip cos with big ai departments ready for big ol entreprise contracts

the upcoming major iot adoption via regulatory enforcement

 on this i can single out an event that most people are sleeping on the us food supply chain is about to undergo massive digital transformation with fsma the fda food safety modernization act  think big data lakes and lots of machine learning having to be adopted at gunpoint in unseen rates all across the food supply chain

upstreamdownstream innovation in private markets

 ai tech has been commoditized can be forked api called build on top of its pretty fluid and easy to access as i type this theres tens of thousands of ai startups across all imaginable industries getting past productmarketfit hurdles opening distribution channels and ultimately expanding the ai global total addressable market  this early stage innovation will trickle down into public markets in record time wait a few months

my ai investment strategy  ai investing in ai kinda quirky huh

to create my strategy i asked an ai tool can you create a momentum trading strategy focused on aifocused stocks  


xb



the aicreated strategy was interesting but i then made some tweaks based on the basket of ai stocks i wanted to include in this momentum trading approach i removed International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) as i dont think theyll be a key beneficiary or leader in the ai race and added pltr for defencegovernment ai exposure Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) for some semiconductor exposure and meta this is a questionable one but the open source models that their research team have created our worldclass and i dont want to bet against zuck

you can see the final strategy below one potential concern i have is the max drawdown from the backtests is a little higher than id like but im willing to roll with it this week lets see how it does

this strategy is a macro focused etf strategy rather than individual stocks so should help to balance my risk a little better

Trading strategy,StockMarket,"Is ONLY Trading When The Stock Market is UP, Possibly The BEST Strategy For Day Trading? :)","just out of curiosity is there anyone here that only day trades on days when the stock market and by that i pretty much mean the sp  since it represents most of the stock market is doing well

as mark cuban says everyone is a genius with day trading when the stock market is doing well

others also say that just about any day strategy works really well when the stock market is doing well for the day

i have to say my trades always seem to work out better on days when the stock market is up

so again does anyone here only day trade when the stock market is actually up i know that obviously limits how often you can trade but if you have a much higher win rate and can potentially go for bigger gains does that make it a good strategy  

i know it sounds like common sense but i doubt many people use this as their actual main strategy but some must right",8,you should write for market watch,"conceptually correct all the trades working for big corporations do well when the market keep going up it is during blip in the market you see that they failed

goes for commodity eg oil goes for mutual fund managers
you will get to ask your k managers why they failed to stop loss in the future hedge fund wants  with that they are in red more often then not",i personally do better on red days i think for me red means go and green means stop
Trading strategy,StockMarket,Broken Wing Butterfly Options Trading Strategy,"what it is

there are several ways you can view a broken wing butterfly 

you can view it as an unbalanced butterfly where the strikes of the long butterfly arent equidistant from the short strike making one wider than the other 

another way to view this strategy is the combination of a credit spread and a debit spread with the same short strike the credit spread will be wider than the debit spread typically allowing you to collect a net credit 

another way to view this strategy is a ratio spread with a further otm long contract to define your risk 

xb

how to set it up

broken wing butterflies can be set up with either calls or puts but for simplicitys sake we will cover an example of setting up a put broken wing butterfly 

the first step is to go to the otm put strikes and sell two of the same strike contracts a common way to determine which strike is by using delta most options traders like to trade broken wing butterflies with the short strike somewhere between  to  delta 

once you sell the short strikes you must buy two puts one will be below the short strike and the other above 

for example if your short strike is  you can buy a  put and a  put in this case you will have a  put debit spread and a  put credit spread

xb

proscons

every options strategy comes with its own pros and cons understanding the advantages and disadvantages of the broken wing butterfly can help you make more informed decisions 

 pros

 hedged against volatility more than a credit spread
 ability to take half the trade off at a time
 potential to make money on both the credit spread and debit spread

 cons

 high commissions since it is a leg strategy
 lower credit collected than a credit spread

Trading strategy,StockMarket,Straddle vs. Strangle Options Trading Strategies,"what is it  


a straddle and a strangle are similar in that they are both options trading strategies that involve holding a long position a call option and a short position a put option on the same underlying asset the important difference between the two is the strike prices of the options 

xb

straddle

in a straddle the strike prices of the call and put options are the same this means that if the underlying stock price moves significantly in either direction the investor can make a profit by exercising one of the options either the call or the put and offsetting the loss on the other option 

strangle

in a strangle the strike prices of the call and put options are different the call option has a higher strike price and the put option has a lower strike price this means that the strangle allows for a greater range of underlying stock prices at expiration in which the options will be in the money and the investor can make a profit 

xb

straddle vs strangle

both straddle and strangle strategies are considered to be highrisk highreward strategies and they are not suitable for all investors its important to have a solid understanding of options trading and the underlying asset before engaging in these strategies and also to be aware of the risks and costs involved straddle is considered to be riskier than strangle because with a straddle the investor has to pay a higher premium than with strangle

Options trading,StockMarket,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,"i want to preface this post by saying that i personally only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks with that being said i have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis if you already have a bit of experience with options this post may not be very beneficial to you because im just going to cover the basics of options how they work and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them

first and foremost what are options options are actually options when you buy an option contract you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a predetermined price up to a prespecified date if you decide to do this you are then exercising your options

there are two types of options that you can trade which are call options and put options call options or just calls allow the holder to buy at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock because of this your call options price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises put options or just puts allow the holder to sell at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to shortselling the underlying stock because of this your put options price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines because one single option contract represent  shares of the underlying stock you would have  shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised



now the predetermined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contracts is known as the strike price when buying options you have to choose a strike price along with an expiration date which is the last day that your options can be exercised both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy because they greatly affect how the options will trade before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options its important to know a bit more general options information

as for strike prices there are really two main kinds in the money itm and out of the money otm itm and otm refer to the underlying stocks price in relation to the strike price of the contract calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered itm whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered otm on the other side of the spectrum since you want the stocks price to go down when you own puts your put options would be itm if the strike price is above the current stock price and otm if the strike price is below the current stock price



i know its a bit confusing if youre new to options to give an example if stock xyz was trading at  a call option with a strike price of  would be itm since the underlying stock is already above the strike price however since calls and puts are essentially opposite a put with a strike price of  would be an otm put in this scenario

whether an option is itm or otm has a big impact on how to option will trade the main reason for this is because all otm options are worthless at expiration this means that if you invested  by buying one call option at   x  your contract would be worth  if it was otm at the markets close on the expiration date and you would lose your full  investment because of this otm options are generally higher risk higher reward than itm options although itm wont be worthless at expiration like otm options they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay

time decay in options causes the price of the contracts also known as the premium to decrease as it gets closer to expiration this alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay so in order to profit from options you have to not only be right about the stocks direction but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay

time decay along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts are represented by what are known as greeks the greeks are theta vega delta and gamma like i said the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so im not going to go into a ton of detail on the greeks in this post but i do at least want to explain theta theta is the greek representing time decay in options you can see an options theta along with the other greeks before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay generally the theta will be higher for otm options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at  similarly theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches

theta makes general trading rules like dont fight the trend even more important for example if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support so in this situation youd be correct about the stock finding the bottom but you would still lose money if it didnt start to bounce back up quickly if you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options youd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support



although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades there is actually a way to have it work in your favor you can short options contracts which is also called writing just like with shorting stocks you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short in my opinion this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling

the reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts you would lose money as the options increase in price its the same reason that many people are afraid to shortsell stocks but options are generally more volatile which creates even more risk even though i wouldnt necessarily recommend it for beginners i wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post

regardless of how you trade options its important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced like any other type of trading you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options especially if youre trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time

maybe after this youll see why i stick to trading stocks rather than options they can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders but theyre much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns

hope this was helpful let me know what ya think",401,"i appreciate the enthusiasm and time taken for this thoughtful post  in my opinion its a good intro but it doesnt prepare anyone to trade options especially to be a premium seller

theres more to options than youve described here  one glaring omission is implied volatility  its what usually leads new option traders to ask why did my call go down in value even though the stock went up in price  you mention theta  aside from time iv is a major contributor to that","great post mate

people who think this is easy cash get slaughtered 

when i was asked by my colleagues why i dont trade options i always outline that of course you can lose every thing with stocks but lets face it  having stocks like microsoft or JOHNSON & JOHNSON (JNJ) in your portfolio means your most likely not gonna lose  in a week",great started guide if i had awards to give youd get one all i can send is that orange arrow

Fundamental analysis,StockMarket,Fundamental Analysis; Alphabet Inc $GOOGL,"hello rstockmarket

even in these tough times i keep chopping away at the research and analysis that i always do todays writeup is about alphabet Suncor Energy (Inc.)more commonly known as the parent company of google ticker googl as always this is my own fundamental analysis and the writeup that follows i employ trend research and discounted cash flow analysis and it is fully up to you if you want to take anything here written as fact numbers and information is taken from the th quarter of  and earlier that said here is my view of alphabet inc

the company  
alphabet is an holding and parent company of many subsidiaries focusing on technology what kind of technology you ask well a ton of it here is a list of some of the subsidiaries that alphabet has under its massive technological wing

 google an internet company focusing on its famous search engine advertising business and video service through youtube it goes without saying that google is by far the largest and most profitable of alphabets businesses
 calico a rd biotech company
 chronicle a cybersecurity and antihacking company
 dandelion a geothermal energy startup company
 deepmind an artificial intelligence company
 gv google venture a strategic investment company
 capitalg google capital a profitdirected investment company
 google fiber a developer for fiber networking and an isp 
 nest labs a home automation company develops programmable home appliances 
 jigsaw google ideas a tech incubator company focusing on unique technology
 sidewalk labs urban innovation company developer within infrastructure and urban technology
  verily google x lifescience research and development company
 waymo world leading company in autonomous driving

as you can see the list of technological focuses is incredibly broad alphabet is an ad company that puts all its profits into developing thousands of products to revolutionize the future

  

fundamentals  forecasts   
alphabet has a annual revenue of  billion resulting in a gross profit of  billion and a net profit earnings of  billion that is an  increase in revenue year to year yy alphabets numbers are slightly jumbled up recently as this quarter like many other tech giants in the us following the tax reform of the new year moved huge amount of international profits into the us this resulted in alphabets tax rate for q  to become  of their pretax income we have to adjust for this one time payment as alphabet moves that money into the country to invest in their capital expenditure and rd the company has a historical tax rate of roughly  which is very low also of note alphabet has during the last  years fairly consistently increased their rd spending by  yy each quarter really highlighting how the company is putting more and more money into their technology rd their general operating margin is roughly  which is also very high but not uncommon in the ad market a last notion to mention is that alphabet is after their intake of additional saved up international cash very net cash positive with a war chest of  billion as a huge part of alphabet is founding its own startups acquiring other startups that have potential and investing in either one their huge war chest is a very strong advantage for them to have 

alphabet is huge its enormous this makes forecasting complicated as they can have huge swings if their profitability goes down and it could be very hard to recover i preface the next message with this so you as a reader is aware alphabet right now has amazing fundamentals the company is incredibly strong they have the historical income numbers of a growth company while being profitable and stable these are facts that make alphabet very fundamentally sound

 if we assume that alphabet reached their growth peak in  and from there have a steady growth slowdown until they run into a complete growthstop in  as well as maintained tax rate  gross  operating margin  respective  we still see upside in its current price these calculations were done at a  maturity rate along with a discount rate of  these are fairly standard industry numbers using this pessimistic view of the company in my eyes seeing no further improvement the net present stock value would end up at  a valuation upside of  after the recent drop the more realistic scenario is the same except that we maintain the current growth for the coming year and then seeing a slower maturity drop until the growthstop we see an  upside

the recent discussions about alphabet is its issues with TransAlta Corporation (TAC) traffic acquisition cost that is the cost that alphabet pays to get traffic to their services where the expense is increasing and margins decreasing fairly rapidly at the beginning of  the ad revenue of  million was hurt by a TransAlta Corporation (TAC) of  million which is an TransAlta Corporation (TAC) cost of sale of  of the ad revenue these numbers increased to  million  million and  respectively now at the end of  the TransAlta Corporation (TAC) expense grows  faster than the ad revenue this is clearly a problem for google as a service and as their margins fall this causes real concern about their profitability if we apply a lowering margin down from a very consistent  gross margin after cost of sales down  per year down to  we see the net present evaluation drop to  per share a  downside this is a real risk and is the scenario where google slowly loses its iron grasp on the ad industry the very realistic scenario the middle ground is where alphabets margins drop from their consistent  to  by   gross margin was what happened this last quarter q which caused the  drop in value along with uncertainties in the overall market if alphabet never recovers from this drop in margin their current valuation is fair if they recover but slowly struggle down to  again even slowly down to   they have a very slight downside as you can see this is a potential problem for google it is worth pointing out that this drop is very abrupt a blip and is no proof of any sort of a trend a similar company facebook fb has a gross margin of  which shows that higher margins is also attainable

  


my view  
alphabet has been my personal favorite company since i became an adult which makes me slightly biased i am happy to report that my financial knowledge tells me that they also deserve the praise i give them personally the company is amazing attaining growth numbers that shouldnt happen to large businesses like this most analysts are right to worry about the recent decline in gross margins but if these are improved they should be a catalyst that removes the sliver of doubt that is the only thing holding alphabets price down i will most certainly hold alphabet through that it is such a diverse business deep into the future of tech supported by the greatest ad company this world have ever seen they are regulated hard to leave their main product google search engine unbiased as if they were greedy with it could dominate any market that power is impossible to put a  on

i personally believe that google is a perfect buying opportunity for a very long term investment they will get their margins back on track their excellent management fully understand this it might not be the next quarter it might not be the quarter after that however if we assume that their operating margins look very realistic bordering pessimistic and that they recover their margin issue over the next  years their net present stock value is  a  upside this doesnt make alphabet a snap purchase but it makes them a fair purchase when you buy alphabet you buy a sliver of the future they have their hand in every single futuristic technology everything from biotech to ai and selfdriving cars to vrar to the internet of things they are industry leaders in all of these barring biotech tough industry when these markets become profitable in the future your good purchase of alphabet today becomes an excellent hedge into the rd of the future

i bought alphabet right before the drop of  my only mistake is that i did not buy more however it turned out fine since it tanked i am happy people doubt their margins because when they recover i will own a lot more alphabet than i would have without the drop

if you would like the model ill be happy to send it over

edit considering a large amount of people wanting to see the model i post the final version here instead of sending them through pms keep in mind before you take any information away from it this is only a part of the fundamental analysis so dont get caught up on it as well a lot of unsaved editing have been made during the course of the analysis this is only the final iteration and the last viewpoint i have made this version of the model have the tabs on capex and free cash flow missing",174,im always down to see a spreadsheet so id be interested,ill send out spreadsheets tomorrow morning,obly thing i dont like is the high price makes it hard if you dont have alot of liquidity
Fundamental analysis,StockMarket,Fundamental Analysis????,"so iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been really trying to do my homework and become an intelligent investor i keep reading book after book on the market because i dont want to be just another retail investor im interested in money and the markets and how they work im now in my s i grew up in a middleclass home and went to public school and any sort of knowledge on these topics just wasnt available where im from

i just finished reading one up on wall street by peter lynch and im a quarter of the way through a random walk down wall street

finally id like to ask everyones opinion on fundamental analysis the techniques that lynch talks about seem dated and not really relevant to the present day stock market the market of today is so overweight by lynchs standards plus you have history being made with the whole meme stock situation group psychology and momentum seem more important than actual value id really be interested to know some opinions on the things im stating and what techniques people currently use to make their financial decisions in todays crazy times i really appreciate everyones time and experience and im hoping to learn and discuss thank you",13,"i think the best thing to do is to set up a budget and go do it look at some companies do some E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) buy some shares and test your E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD)

im all for reading books from these legends iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been listening to peter lynches audiobooks and i like his take on things 

but nothing has taught me more than trying to figure out what i did wrong or right the great thing about us stocks is you can test your hypotheses with  share so it wont cost you that much","there is an old saying in investing  fundamentals dont matter until they do 

that means that fundamentals will eventually trump in the minds of a majority of investors that trade into a stock waiting for that time however can lead to a lot of opportunity cost since you are young and you have the time fundamental investing will serve you well over the long haul as long as you stay disciplined in your investing",i follow  and use some of his spreadsheets  i particularly like his analyses of tsla and abnb that helped me better under the nuances of valuations just search his blog and watch the videos

paypal is a company that works with payments solutions and the transfer of currency noncrypto for both businesses and private individuals paypal make their revenue from both a steady and  fee on each transaction that they process the current value of paypal is  billion usd a quite steep price for a company such as this a trailing pe of  paypal has also both started and acquired a basket of payment services each focusing on different type of transactions 

to name a few

braintree payments a one stop shop online merchant system
venmo a peerpeer mobile payment system
paydiant a seamless mobile payment system for businesses walmart uses paydiant in their digital systems
xoom a remittance company focusing on fardistance transfers over long distances for emerging markets
modest a simple payment system for online merchant with focus on ease of implementation

as you can see they have a clear focus but claim a strong brand within their sector fintech payments

 fundamentals    
paypal generated  billion dollars of revenue last quarter with an average revenue growth of roughly  yy in the last  quarters they have an operating margin around  and a net margin of  these low margins are very common for payment solution companies as they handle a huge amount of capital speaking of capital the total payment volume tpv is the driving earnings generator for the company is at  billion usd and is increasing  yy in the last  quarters keep in mind that the tpv growth is increasing quarter to quarter tpv growth is really what drives the business and the tpv growth and revenue growth has a roughly  correlation where tpv increases a bit faster than the revenue itself paypal as of today pays roughly  effective tax making them incredibly efficient turning volume into net profit it is also worth pointing out that paypal is debtless and is  billion net positive cash in their warchest

eBay Inc. (EBAY)  war on cash  
paypal is currently down for this year after they were announced to be dropped from eBay Inc. (EBAY) as the primary payment service since eBay Inc. (EBAY) want to collect payment fees themselves this caused a rough  drop in the price of paypal it is currently very uncertain how much this hurts paypal as eBay Inc. (EBAY) payment volume is today  of paypals tpv on top of this something known as the war on cash is going on all over the world right now if you are not aware of this for sure do your research if you are interested in payment technology right now a majority of the worlds transactions happen through cash but the  of cash transactions compared to the  digital payment transactions is currently is shrinking fast this translates to every single payment companys market is growing daily  

estimates  result  
so following the guidance put down by paypal in their last er gives  an tpv growth of  as well as a revenue of  billion usd as well as their past performance while maintaining margins we are expected to see an increase in profits with an eps going from  in  to  in  in my usual processes i try to be conservative i attempt to capture a conservative scenario that is very likely and do not expect anything amazing to happen optimism is not better than realism in the market i usually see what a company is valued at assuming the company peaked in the last quarter reported assuming that their own guidance is correct for  and that slowly their growth will go down after peaking in  their net present value ends up at  billion usd which is  less than their current market cap at  billion usd this would put paypal into overpriced ranged however there are some interesting things around here as paypals market the payment market grows rapidly there is tons of potential that is hard to calculate fundamentally if the entire market grows to its full size which would be roughly by rds and paypal takes a portion of that market share their growth rate would increase rapidly a sign of this is their increasing growth in tpv the model which assumes peak in  leaves their net present stock value at  usd a  downside to its current valuation the more optimistic model which i also find more realistic is where paypal have at least  more years of growth until they peak in this scenario they maintain their revenue growth of  until  while maintaining margins after that peak slowly decline by  per year with a discount rate of  fair id say their net present stock value is at  usd  upside


conclusion  
paypal is a very tough company to evaluate one of the hardest iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) ever analyzed they are a growth company for sure but a very expensive one they are priced at a point where they keep growing without many issues if you assume peak in  they are overvalued  so PartnerRe Ltd. (PRE) correction and  now however assuming payment solution growth companies peaking this year is practically assuming the companys failure there is not success without additional growth there is for sure risk there especially with events like eBay Inc. (EBAY) dropping them note it was not unexpected but bad nonetheless its hard to estimate how much it damages them if at all and if similar things will happen when competition with lower prices arise however all this said there is so much to like a debtless company that is top of their respective field rdwise making great profits even if you are paying quite a bit for that profit at trailing pe of  as the digital payment volume increases paypal will gain a portion of that which makes paypal a stable purchase if you want to bet against cash which is smart the questions to look out after are for sure

how does paypal maintain their revenue to tpv ratio this number is crucial as they most likely will increase their tpv one problem might be that they have to lower their fees to compete in the future
how does the competition look the world if filled with competition and its truly fierce here any provider that is cheaperas cheap andor easieras easy will outcompete paypal rapidly
where is the expected revenue peak if you assume it  it looks pretty bad if you assume it later it start looking good fast

if we see an increase in guidance as well as results in  it will be good enough news to maintain the goal of not peaking before  which would make paypal a  upside purchase today

my take  
i believe in paypal however i much more strongly believe in the profitability of the war on cash i think that if you are not invested in the war you are making a huge mistake

good places to be include  v visa Suncor Energy (Inc.)pypl paypal and ma mastercard

i currently own paypal it is currently just below  of my portfolio i am down  after their earnings and eBay Inc. (EBAY) announcement the earnings looked better than i expected and i am very pleased i plan to average down to roughly  of my portfolio and hold very long term until i can reap the benefits of the transition to a cashless world i would buy visa over paypal as it comes with less risk i will make a writeup on them next i own both the same amount 

thanks for reading

ulykosen",111,hey this fantastic wherehow did you learn how to analyze this stuff im not sure where to start,pypl is the only stock im long on thanks for the write up,"great write up im so optimistic about pypl and bearish about ebays future as someone who has made a small fortune by reselling things online for over  years i can tell you eBay Inc. (EBAY) is quickly falling out of favor there are so many smaller second hand markets that have emerged niche sites like grailed discogs and reverb are quickly gaining ground the one thing they have in common paypal there are even hundreds of niche forums that have their own marketplaces even reddit has places like hardware swap people are even selling on fb now the one payment method they use paypal its come to a point where paypal is now a verb and it makes sense to not sell on eBay Inc. (EBAY) because they charge a ridiculous  for anything sold

and thats not even considering the future of venmo which is a monster by itself and zero debt paypal is very well run company with a lot of growth ahead of it"
Fundamental analysis,StockMarket,Fundamental analysis tool for entire exchanges,"hi all 
over the past few years iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been trying to expand my ability to do fundamental analysis read a number of books and have come to a comfortable place with it though still felt frustrated in my attempts to analyse data freely copying page after page of financial data into spreadsheets just didnt cut it i felt surely if the maths was right then i should just run it on every company and pick the best regardless of how popular it is 

so i recently started creating this tool for myself 

it does the following

 gather financial statement data off multiple exchanges currently sp dow National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) ftse

 calculate statistical measures for all listed companies eg piotroski f scores

 summarise all this in a single excel spreadsheet

the basic system is there now and running on my pc but i could make it better in future i hope to include discounted cashflows and earnings consistency id like to get your opinions if you had a tool that could do this what sort of fundamental statistics would you be interested in seeing",3,"if you are having it pull things like f scores why not include some of the more basic measures im thinking
 pe ratio and forward pe ratio
 sales growth yoy
 earnings growth yoy
etc

just a thought",i dont understand  bit what you linked step  making it user friendly and visualized,you cant use fundamentals in this market
Fundamental analysis,StockMarket,Fundamental Analysis on Why GME is Still a Buy,"hi there

i posted this on another sub but folks told me to post on others so more people understand the fundamental case for Gamestop Corporation (GME)  long time lurker first time poster on a new account thanks to wsb and  i was able to go from k in april to just passing the mm mark ousing leads i found reddit along with my own E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD)  big plays were pton  Nuveen Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NIO)  nvax  now Gamestop Corporation (GME) proof up k of gains since jan   no idea how to go further back on tastyworks mods lmk if you need more proof

xb



i havent been seeing a lot of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) on Gamestop Corporation (GME) fundamentals so i figure it was my time to give back with some research on why i still think Gamestop Corporation (GME) is a still value play not just momentum heres why i believe gmes current valuation is no more out of whack than the rest of the market and why it still has so much more room to run

 gmes ecommerce

what if we stripped out all of gmes brick and mortar business and just looked at it as an ecommerce business here are the stats vs some comps

Gamestop Corporation (GME) b  growth q yoy

chewy b mo ending   growth q yoy enterprise value  enterprise value to revenue 

stitchfix b mo ending   growth q yoy enterprise value  enterprise value to revenue 

crazy when you look at it this way how much would an ecommerce company with b in revenue growing at  a year be worth with todays valuations if you used chewys Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) to revenue of  for Gamestop Corporation (GME) you get a valuation of b or a stock price of about  but wait a second gmes ecommerce grew almost x faster than chewys and x faster than stitchfix this last quarter

for a high watermark of a evrev in ecommerce we can see poshmark with an evrev of  they have a secondhand social marketplace for apparel which is not a leap from gamestops game trade in model using that Gamestop Corporation (GME) should have an Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) of b or a share price of  and that is using a preryan cohen ecomm revenue imagine how much itll rocket now that hes on the board hedge funds will probably argue that Gamestop Corporation (GME) got a one time boost from the launch of new consoles but you can say the same thing about folks avoiding dressing rooms in retailers across the country

too long; didn't read Gamestop Corporation (GME) is worth somewhere between  per share with their ecommerce biz alone at todays valuations and that was preryan cohen

 gmes brick and mortar

in that first part i highlighted why Gamestop Corporation (GME) is worth it on ecommerce alone brick and mortar is where i am really excited hedge funds will tell you it has been a drain on earnings and that all transactions are becoming digital to date that has been true with Gamestop Corporation (GME) reporting terrible numbers since the start of the pandemic but what if Gamestop Corporation (GME) took the consumer obsessed mindset that had in chewy applied it to a bigger total addressable market tam in gaming and they had physical storefronts as assets the possibilities are endless if Gamestop Corporation (GME) pushes the limits of innovation

a couple of examples

 back when best buy began their turn around they started monetizing their store footprint for their storeinastores most of the electronics manufacturers like samsung needed a showroom but didnt want to build the infrastructure to compete with the apple stores they realized having a neutral showroom was critical to competing and were willing to pay rent the revenue sharing agreement with microsoft looks like a step in this direction as microsoft closed their storefronts earlier this year





 imagine if Gamestop Corporation (GME) competed with the likes of twitch but their asset was physical locations think mini esports arenas where retail was a side benefit instead of the endallbe all many tabletop gaming stores having this as a model it could be a reimagination of s arcades



 build a pc kiosks that are coming i believe no matter how much things go digital there is going to be a need for hardware and peripherals at least for the forseeable future



this could be a situation where    where a robust growing ecommerce platform could complement an amazing inperson experience  and one that others cant replicate so while the current valuation is supported by the ecommerce business alone the instore opportunities could make this an amazing buy plus they are closing unproductive stores their debt levels arent crazy and are close to being free cash flow positive despite the lock down id argue the gamestop brand recognition alone is worth b of goodwill

too long; didn't read Gamestop Corporation (GME) bm is a drag on the books but there is huge opportunity

 how did hedge funds miss this

in order for hedge funds to get their massive returns they gross up meaning they take an equal amount of long and short bets to stay neutral to the market while taking crazy amounts of leverage their macro bet was simple long ecommerce short brick and mortar and that was right to an extent Gamestop Corporation (GME) was a perfect target Brunswick Corporation (BC) of software transactions going digital but i think they missed one big thing the risk is asymmetric now Brunswick Corporation (BC) of the feds printers going brrrrrrrrrrrrrr they bet on a bunch of companies going bankrupt but many arent because of the easy access to cheap liquidity so the short side cant go down anymore which means their risk is way out of whack and they overly suppressed valuations on the short side

i think also Gamestop Corporation (GME) is also a special case where wall street used traditional bm retailer valuations when there is so much more opportunity here b of ecommerce growing at  is out of this world for the next  years i dont see game hardware and peripherals going away which is still a huge tam i dont think any other meme stock has this story ryan cohen saw it we see but the talking heads on cnbc dont seem to as of yet this valuation is still great and no where near what we are seeing with all the ipos out there like how does palantir have a b valuation with m of revenue growing at  gmes ecomm business beats in revenue and growth it really just goes against the hedge fundmedia narrative of value and their traditional dcfs i could see this rubber banding back up on pure value once they are back to a positive eps and beyond once the ecommerce really takes off i may need to hold for a year but i see strong growth ahead regardless

position  shares of long stock otm naked short puts for premium and potential average down

too long; didn't read if wallstreet is okay with tech valuations Gamestop Corporation (GME) is still a buy not for the squeeze but as a mid to long term growth play as in may need to hold for a year  great entry point right now 

obligatory this is not financial advice i just like the stock",43,im holding    not because of a squeeze but because of this if they were to take half there stores close them and the other half as pick up locations for ecommerce do warehousing and add pc components etc could even add a steam like store i see no reason for gamestop to actually close that would be like a blockbuster to ignorant to conform,"typically after a scenario like this you will have so many bag holders that it essentially sets a roof on the stock price  any time it starts going up those bag holders sell in relief causing stock to placate 

hard to say what the fair value should be im sure it will go down too much as well temporarily if it hasnt already and then have a decent rebound",i originally took a position on Gamestop Corporation (GME) because of the potential short squeeze and while my average cost is not too high its definitely above the current market price this was reassuring to read and allows me to come to terms with my situation knowing theres a possibility for Gamestop Corporation (GME) to have a bright future is enough reassurance to continue holding shares for me everyone stuck with shares right now might not be in vain

Fundamental analysis,StockMarket,AIRLINES Fundamental Analysis,"hey guys newbie here looking to place some bets on the airline industry and hoping it will pay off long term with just  of my portfolio

i was looking at the financial statements of ten different airlines and was wondering the following

 what are the most important criteriaratiofundamentals when selecting an airline company to put my money on

 which airlines have the most chance of staying afloat after this beer virus situation ends and why

let me know your thoughts from my inexperience iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) selected in order Southwest Airlines Company (LUV) dal alk rya Alliance Capital Management Holding L.P. (AC)",2,why not just buy etf of airlines,"usually the most important ratio to me is pe  but given the last  months is not a strong indicator of the next  id look at debt to equity Southwest Airlines Company (LUV) has a low debt to equity compared to the others but also has a higher pe forward pe is pure speculation at this point

also look at cash flow and specifically their current cash on hand  if they have low debt and lots of cash theyll survive the longest 

price to book is also another good one in case they actually do go under or can start selling assets to stay afloat

good luck",you want to look for a strong balance sheet right now because cash flow has become nearly nonexistent so some important ratios to look at will be the current ratio the quick ratio and the debtassets ratio youll also want to make sure the company has been increasing its revenue while holding steady margins before covid another thing to consider is the fact that this could cause a recession so discount airlines may be particularly resilient during a postvirus recession

for reference my next potential entries will depend on developments in the biggerpicture macro sentiment toward artificial intelligence  microchip industries but for now are as follows entry  is around  entry  is around  and entry  around  was thinking i would add  or  shares at entry  and then larger numbers of shares if price action takes us down to the other  circled areas wondering whether any of you guys think the price will reach as low as  in the coming months because it seems like the stock just keeps on running higher recently with so much positive media coverage",6,wow such lines and formidable couleurs  very technical and very analysis,"for the best probability bull play you add an incremental long position after the upper level of the recent gap up or thereabouts actually holds as support on nontrivial volume that gap might get filled in the relatively near term

as a high probability bull play anyone should have bought a significant long position as soon as the price gapped up to exceed its most recent previous novdec  high point

after any blue sky breakout on strong volume the long position benefits from the fundamental reality of whos going to sell the stock now   answer not so many until market conditions or company circumstances change",it is overpriced and a speculation bubble if you are comfortable investing based on speculation i think your entry points are fair tesla is similar these companies will take a decade for the value to catch up to current prices wait for the random crash to buy in

Technical analysis,StockMarket,Two Questions About Technical Analysis,"i know people liken technical analysis to astrology but in my humble opinion technical analysis can give an idea of how mr market feels about a company basically when a company is oversold it means mr market hates it and when its overbought then mr market is in love with it having said that im not a technical investor i would base  of the investing decision on fundamental analysis and only  on technical analysis thats how i personally see it but im not really an expert so take what i say with a ton of salt

if you happen to use technical analysis in your decisionmaking process which chart do you use do you use the yearly quarterly monthly weekly or daily and why do you prefer that time frame

finally which indicators do you think show the overbought and oversold states",1,"ta works great to predict a likely move for some patterns like a falling wedge for example
  the challenge is picking the price target to complete the trade  if you get greedy then you could just watch it reverse on you  if you arent greedy enough then its not even worth the risk  

i look at many different time frames as some patterns will take much longer to play out 

but i have a day job and i dont daytrade i just use it to help decide a good time to buy into a stock i like or sell off a profitable position that i dont believe in medium to long term","i trade primarily through technical analysis  i use the  minute  daily charts for day trading the daily  weekly charts for swing trading and the weekly  monthly chart for investments

in other words a charts time frame factors into how long you should expect the probabilities to play out in the way the chart indicates technical analysis is just a way to interpret probabilities a trader who goes long on a stock as it forms a bull flag on its daily chart should not expect the bull flag to play out intraday but instead over the course of days or weeks  so the time frame you choose should be matched to how long you want to be in a trade",i use technical analysis as part of picking a price for buys and sells within a narrow price range based on things like the historical pe  it hasnt worked especially well for protecting me from losses but i have more confidence buying below the  day moving average than above it  technical analysis is my lucky charm for confidence

recap in the planning for today i was watching  as a pivot zone with shorts below it and longs above to the short side the market never actually closed a candle below  but in the interest of transparency i erroneously entered anyways and was fortunate enough to quickly exit the trade to the long side i wrote that if i were to trade it id look for some consolidation beneath or at  that lasts a while  minutes and breakthrough this happened about  minutes after the open today but since i made a mistake earlier i followed my rules and did not trade again this was clearly the signal the market gave to me but ill chalk it up to being a monday and move on 

balancetrend the market remains in a broad balance area from  and the next trend leg up or down will look to materialize outside of that range the market is trading about  points above the month yellow trend line that the market recovered last week and needs to hold  tomorrow to keep it intact since late july the market is in a down trend marked in black with resistance at  

analysis the overnight and cash session made for a fairly standard balanceconsolidation day finding support near  and resistance at  the market was able to breakout from the bull flag and validate it though the market remains in a broad balance area which makes it difficult to draw any conclusions beyond that the gap beginning at  is severely weakened by this point and a breach of it could trigger a strong rally that fills the gap and moves higher to  and  breaking back down below   lowest is a rejection of the value established over the last week and could get the market back to the yellow trend line any breakdown below  is an early warning sign that bulls have lost control of the market

Technical analysis,StockMarket,"From my noob perspective, technical analysis is nonsense.","granted i could be very wrong as im very new to the game

but from watching a ton of videos showing how various indicators predict price direction  of them do the following

hey lets look at this ema line  you see how the price broke through it and continues to ride above it  that means its trending up and its probably a good time to buy  now see how it quickly dipped below the ema line and is now consistently below it  that means the ema line became the new resistance

uhhhh ok so were just gonna gloss over the dipped below the ema part  if the price can just randomly dip below that ema at any point then what the hell is the point of all this  its like saying to run without falling just keep running and when you fall that means you fell  great

i see them do the same shit with all the different indicators",187,if technical analysis did work youd see these youtubers running top funds instead of playing drawing games with price and volume information  ask yourself why theyd give away information that has the ability to produce outsized gains  ask yourself why no top investors reference ta in their investing strategies  then look up the empirical tests of ta strategies and realize that its pure superstition and cognitive biases being expressed in the investing world,yeah how can moving averages and such have forecasting power in a stochastic process,its just one of many tools i dont think all of it is nonsense averages highlow volume supportresistance etc are all very useful in helping make a decision on an entry point for example the problem starts when people who are looking for a shortcut look for nonexistent patterns and day trade purely on shapes
Technical analysis,StockMarket,SP500 Technical Analysis & Trading Plan for 10/10/23,"i share my plan for discussion or education and it is not intended for use as trade recommendations or ideas

recap in the plan for today i said that the trendline that bulls needed to recover was at  and that i would want to see if the market can test s and then recover  to go long this played out to perfection and the market set the days lows right at that level and then moved  points higher the first way to trade this was in the premarket when it reclaimed about  minutes before the open however i didnt get the setup i wanted here and didnt take this trade

i instead opted to enter long at the  level and wrote that i would expect sellers to push back a bit and test buyers strength there and that i would want to wait for that pullback and then enter over  this ended up pulling back to the trendline at  set the lows and i entered per my rules i took less risk than i normally do given that the market had already moved up quite a bit but the trade worked out fine and moved right to  and the next level at  i normally remove all risk at a target in the  point range and took my profits there

balancetrend after breaking higher from the month trendline friday and briefly dipping below it again on news of the war breaking out over the weekend the market recovered the trendline today and closed well above it bulls did what they needed to and now this trend support moves to  in the nearer term the market is still flagging from the july highs and is in the pullback channel marked in black for the time being finally the market has broken out from the recent balance zone by clearing the highs at 

analysis the market has rallied for two consecutive sessions after finding support at the black channel lows and recovering the yearlong trend line up in doing so the market also backtested the breakout level from may at  and the  day moving average and has made an early recovery after such a strong move there may be a cooling off period or some consolidation before the next trend move materializes i will be watching for a failure at  as an early warning sign that the market is breaking down again but bulls mainly need to keep the market above  to keep control of the market a failure to hold the trend line  absolute lowest would put bears back in charge and likely trigger deeper selling to

Technical analysis,StockMarket,SP500 Technical Analysis & Trading Plan,"i share my plan for educational purposes and discussion and it is not intended for use as trade recommendations or ideas this plan uses the futures market for levels 

recap i noted in the plan for today that the market was finding some near term balance and trying to trade too many levels or setups in this environment usually leads to losses there were several pieces of the plan that would have worked for today though and the goal is always to catch one of them 

in the plan for today there were several setups that i mapped out that i could have or maybe should have traded one such setup was at the key support zone at  and i said that i would look to play it either as support at  or that another option would be to let the market test below the friday lows and try to reclaim that range in order to get into a long i took this trade at about  est just before the market settled into an hourlong point range that really tested my patience volume entered the market and i exited the majority of the trade at the next level  and left a runner to exit at the pink trendline at  

balancetrend the market traded lower overnight and then sharply rejected yesterdays range at the open today the primary structure right now is the downtrend outlined in black the market is still holding both of the aqua blue trend lines which define the trend from march so this is still the bigger trend to watch 

analysis the market is working inside of the downsloping black channel in the charts and found support there today for the third time coinciding with another backtest to the ascending triangle structure in pink at  the market broke out from this structure on july  this was also the basis for the  support level and its important that bulls hold these levels if this breakout is to remain intact with no economic releases tomorrow ahead of inflation data on the backend of the week it would not surprise me to see periods of chop tomorrow 

it is now essential that bulls hold  for a sustained move higher and in an effort to reclaim the pink trendline at  with this level breaking down twice now though and todays close beneath it its on the verge of irrelevance moving back inside of this trend though could accelerate the bull case and push the market back to testing the expanding range lows  and then the very important balance area which has already been retested once at

Risk management,StockMarket,"Should banks be even private, management makes millions but they cannot manage any risk?","considering the number of bail outs we had in the past  years and every time there is risk banks start to fail while the management were happily raking in millions as long as they were taking those risks and making money

these institutions are leveraged  times and their whole gamut is taking deposits at something like short term cds and buying long dated stuff like mbs say yielding around  back in 

once fed started raising rates they could not off load those fast enough because they did not want to book even an ounce of loss since that will affect their bonus and now most of them may not be solvent if we mark to market every one of their asset

seems like if we let the fed run these deposit and lending with  transparency about who was given loans at what terms then we may have a stable system which is not on the verge of collapse every  years

but there is a catch it will make all deposits  safe and that will stop investments but i am wondering if we should stop pretending if that is a real problem let the fed handle all the requirements of lending with  transparency

Risk management,StockMarket,Why Do We Underestimate Black Swan Risks? [Managing Black Swan Risk Research Paper,"read full   

xb

 why do we underestimate black swan risks

behavioral scientists postulate that human experiences are often tainted with personal biases and formed from a rather limited time span of observations compared to the likelihood period of most extreme events consider the experience of people in the indian ocean region who had likely never observed or even heard about tsunami whether in normal discourse or in folklore except for a few experts almost no one was aware of their reality and considering the absence of any past observed occurrence or experience no one had visualized this unusual event the new orleans residents had been through a lot of storms before hurricane katrina and nothing that bad had ever happened in hindsight it is clear that there was no engineering redundancy that would save the residents if a large enough storm dumped water in short duration and the levees were breached could someone coming to work in the world trade center towers on the morning of september  have imagined the strange experiences of that day then why are engineers often so dismissive of such scenarios until after they occur

it may be because engineers do not like uncertainty and ambiguity focus on specifics instead of generalities and crave explicit explanations such thinking is shaped by their training in linear logic whereas nearly all black swan events involve complex causal relationships taleb identifies five peculiarities of human behavior responsible for blindness to black swans

xb

 humans tend to categorize focusing on preselected data that reaffirm beliefs as opposed to any contradictions confirmation bias
 humans construct stories to explain events and see patterns in data when none exist due to illusion of understanding narrative fallacy
 human nature is not programmed to imagine black swans
 humans tend to ignore the silent evidence and focus disproportionately either on the failures or successes
 humans overestimate ones knowledge and focus too narrowly on ones field of expertise tunnel vision ignoring other sources of uncertainty and mistaking concocted models for reality ludic fallacy

xb

these peculiarities of human behavior are illustrated here with examples from science and engineering as opposed to talebs general historical and financial focus

xb

 confirmation bias

confirmation bias refers to the human tendency to notice and look for what confirms ones beliefs or prevailing dogma and to ignore or undervalue the relevance of contradictions for a long time astronomers tried fitting observations to models for planetary movements in terms of cycles and epicycles in ptolemys school of thought until the copernican revolution overthrew old models still his contemporaries rejected the new approach until galileos ideas concerning motion finally confirmed their validity similarly einstein had to move beyond accepted wisdom to come up with his theory of relativity

xb

 illusion of understanding or narrative fallacy

narrative fallacy refers to a false sense of comfort from limited data observations leading to wrong conclusions behavioral psychologists call this phenomenon anchoring where one takes observed events and projects them into the future in a straight line there are a host of studies that demonstrate this alltoohuman tendency to assign patterns to random data and create descriptive narratives resulting in focus on the mundane and missing the extraordinary pitfalls of projections from limited data were seen in stretching design parameters beyond limitations of the previous model contributing to failure of the tacoma narrows bridge nasa managers decided to launch the space shuttle challenger during ff conditions despite orings designed for the ff to ff range resulting in its catastrophic failure

xb

 inherent human nature

it has been observed that humans are not programmed to deal with the trap of anticipation waiting for some important event that is expected to occur infrequently nuclear operators are tasked with taking action during an elusive incident that usually never seems to happen the nuclear regulatory commission has found that days months and years of repeated nothingness can often lead to incidents when operators were found asleep on the job most recently at the peach bottom power plant in pennsylvania in a july  incident three ballistic missile crew members fell asleep while holding classified launch code devices at minot air force base in north dakota numerous similar cases can be cited in the airline and marine industries where nothing out of the ordinary is observed for long periods and the deadly combination of fatigue and boredom ultimately leads to that sudden snapthrough moment some of the most terrible eruptions have come from volcanoes that had been inactive since holocene times these examples show that risk never takes a holiday even though it may appear excessively sleepy for long stretches

xb

 silent evidence

silent evidence refers to the difference between the sample one constructs for analysis and the actual reality causing systematic errors from ignoring evidence due to the manner of posing questions or biased sampling before boarding an airplane crash risk of one in yearsyears somehow seems more acceptable than one out of  planes similarly engineers drawing conclusions about the seismic behavior of a component from enumerating the failed components in field surveys would be ignoring the silent evidence provided by survival of thousands of similar components

xb

 ludic fallacy

humans have a tendency for tunnel vision focusing on the known sources of uncertainty and ignoring the complexity of reality as events that have not taken place can not be accounted for one does not have adequate information for prediction particularly since small variation in a variable can cause drastic impact the butterfly effect in chaos theory it is not the random uncertainty of probabilistic models what donald rumsfeld called known unknowns or taleb refers to as gray swans but rather the epistemic uncertainty due to lack of knowledge ie unknown unknowns black swans that is of prime concern no probabilistic model based on inbox thinking can deal with outofbox type events",7,"it might be simpler than that maybe we dont underestimate them maybe the risk is just too low for it to be practically useful to worry about them

like rumsfeld said about his own mistakes in analysis he was overly credulous of claims that known unknowns could be converted into known knowns

black swans have to be known unknowns for your analysis to have meaning the unknown unknowns cant be estimated at all so they cant be underestimated they can only be overestimated things like hurricane risk in la or tsunami risk in the indian ocean those are definitely known unknowns

the danger is exactly the trap rumsfeld fell into thinking you can turn the unknowns into knowns excess belief in the ability to estimate them is more dangerous than ignoring them in favor of the more common and useful known knowns

the big problem with hurricane katrina was that the risk was known but the money wasnt spent to prepare for it having better information about the risks wouldnt have helped because the problems were mostly known knowns only the timing and name of the disaster were unknown in the case of the tsunami it is such a rare event that the local people didnt know about the risk but also the total number of people affected was small",you just described the federal government for us thank you,super thorough  thanks for sharing  in sum many humans do not follow lord baden powells mottoalways be prepared all of the non silver investors sing to the theme music of the smurfs its one thing to be positive however sometimes or oftentimes that positive mindset negates true reality
Risk management,StockMarket,Would you use this TradingView Risk Management Indicator?,"last week i published a post titled  it stirred up a few comments which motivated me to develop a tradingview indicator to show the stop loss and riskreward and also show position size based on predefined values for capital and level of risk in percentage

theres nothing proprietary about this risk management system but what makes this indicator unique is the risk  and position sizing most traders stick with a basic  or  risk rule where they will not risk more than  or  of their capital on any one trade i went further and applied four levels of risk    and  how you apply these different levels of risk is what makes this indicator subjective and unique

here are some common ways on applying risk 

 if the stock is extremely volatile and has a better than  chance of hitting the stop loss then risk only  of your capital on that trade
 if a stock has low volatility and has less than  change of hitting the stop loss then risk  of your capital on that trade
 risking anywhere between  and  is purely based on your intuition and assessment of the market
 if youre on a losing streak and you want to cut back on your position sizing then lowering the risk  can help you weather the storm
 if youre on a winning streak and your entries are experiencing a higher level of success then increase gradually increase the risk  to reap bigger profits

if enough people show interest then i will publish this on tradingview as a public indicator with the source code open to everyone i welcome all feedback thanks

xb",13,interesting concept to say the least i look forward for another tool at my disposal i been using vwap   trailing stop for my trades sometimes i win sometimes i lose to scalpers the market is crazy right now,sounds like a perfectly reasonable risk management strategy to me why not just share the source of the indicator rather than make a post hyping it up just to share it later,nan
Risk management,StockMarket,5 key ideas for risk management,"having good risk management practices is fundamental to any trading or investing strategy as it will help to keep potential losses in our pockets as the oracle of omaha always puts it rule  is not to lose any money and rule  is never to forget rule  at the end of the game long term success will only be achieved if we live to fight enough days and get the necessary experience

with this in mind here are five simple risk management tips that any trader or investor should take into account when navigating the markets

 asset allocation this one applies more to an entire portfolio than a single trade essentially this means to diversify across the types of trade you hold at any given moment the diversification can apply to different companies within an industry different industries in general even trades with different time horizons or using puts and shorts to hedge positions
 position sizing position sizing refers to the portion of your complete account that you are using to buy an asset if you are looking at the screen every second and twitching with every tick then probably you have not developed the mindset to handle that amount of money the good part is that if you are serious in becoming a trader with every trade you make your tolerance goes up which allows you to keep placing bigger bets
 buying in tranches basically this means not buying the full position in one go you could buy in halves or thirds this will allow you more time to manage a trade and make sure you are feeling comfortable especially in tricky markets
 use stop losses for traders we must keep in mind to take small losses quickly for investors this is a bit less so depending on the strategy you can use different type of stops such as trailing stop losses either with percentages or absolute values hard stop losses which is an order at a specific price or closing day stops where you sell the next morning if a stock closes the day below a certain price
 review your time horizon there are many different strategies that are played in different time horizons for example day trading is extremely fast making multiple trades per day momentum and swing trading you hold either a day to a couple of weeks value investing you can hold anywhere from a couple of months to years and finally things like dividend investing you would hold to forever

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been using it about a while to a success but now im thinking that it might be tweaked a little  


  
so basically i have four risk percent thresholds of possible losses    and  each of these is correlated to decimal amount of profit reward part of risk and reward  is   is   is  and  is   


when setting stop losstake profit i first set my entry price from that i calculate stop loss by doing simple equation sl entry  entry  risk percent   


  
after sl is calculated i calculate take profit TPG, N.V. (TP) entry  sl decimalamount entry  


so what do you guys think about it i was thinking that i might be taking too little profit especailly that im more of a swingposition trader  
what would you guys suggest",6,i ignore price altogether and focus only on premium income no stop losses because ultimately i end up with a zero cost basis which means everything is a profit or the stock runs those are my only two outcomes in ten years of trading this way even during the drop after covid i ignored price and focused on premium bottom line find a strategy that works for you if you make money at a rate you are comfortable with then thats all that matters,nan,nan
Market trends,StockMarket,Understand Stock Market Trends for Successful Investing,"xb



investing in the stock market can be a great way to increase your wealth and financial security but before you start investing its important to understand the trends and patterns that drive the stock market analyzing stock market trends can help you make informed decisions about where and when to invest your money

one of the most important things to look for when analyzing stock market trends is the overall direction of the market this includes both shortterm and longterm trends look for signs of whether the market is bullish bearish or somewhere in between pay attention to market indicators such as the sp  the dow jones industrial average and the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) composite

its also important to look at the performance of specific sectors different sectors perform differently during different market conditions for example the technology sector may do well during a bull market while the energy sector may do better during a bear market by understanding how different sectors are performing you can make decisions about what stocks to invest in

another important trend to watch for when analyzing stock market trends is the performance of individual stocks pay attention to the performance of stocks youre interested in investing in look at their performance over time and pay attention to any news or announcements that could affect their performance also keep an eye on the performance of other stocks in the same sector or industry this can help you identify potential opportunities or risks

finally its important to pay attention to economic indicators economic indicators provide insight into the overall health of the economy and they can help you identify potential areas of opportunity or risk pay attention to indicators such as gdp growth inflation employment and consumer spending these can all provide valuable information about the overall direction of the economy and the stock market

Market trends,StockMarket,Micro stock charts - a compact view of market action and trends,"hi

quick background about me i started trading a few years ago eventually realised the importance of charts played around with generating stock chart snapshots as png pics to scan them quickly my background is in software dev but only recently started dabbling in websites decided to try building a website interface for these micro stock charts im aware of reddit rules against self promotion thats not my intent here im just starting out with paid Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS) etc to test the waters

there are plenty of complex charting tools out there but iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) felt something simpler could be built for quick chart viewing iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) also seen sites that show multiple charts in one page which are good but i wanted something where you can load say  or  micro charts at once for quick viewingcomparisonstrendwatching with easy switching between time periods and chart types

as an example iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) attached a screenshot showing a y view on the left and a y view on the right these are the top National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) companies sorted by market cap  iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) highlighted the covid dip that affected most stocks and you can see the recent bull run happening this year from a high level the top  charts are incredibly similar viewing them in a verticalscrolling format im in aus so mainly trade the Australian Securities Exchange (Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. (ASX))

any thoughts in general about this micro stock charts idea do you think theyre useful to view trends across the market quickly what sort of layout would you prefer

Market trends,StockMarket,Pharmaceuticals break COVID lows trend line signaling end to Bear Market,"just because you cant make money using technicals doesnt mean they dont work take your bags elsewhere

i use pharmaceuticals as a bit of a canary in the coal mine for the end of a bear market for the first time since  pharma has signaled that the bear market may be at an end

i use abbv as my go to i think its one of the strongest pharmas without too many legal headaches which is a rare combination considering the field

pharma and utilities are usually the last to puke in a bear market in every major bear market back to the s they typically held their gains through the entirety of the bear market then puked sometimes dumping  after everything else had long bottomed its a weird phenomenon for those two sectors

theres a bull trend line formed by the covid era that abbv respected until this week thus it has finally puked

how hard it will dump is yet to be seen the final test for the bear market is for the spx to retest the week which will be somewhere around spx  in october which is  of the time the typical retest zone where everyone starts to feel the burn and panic

 of bear markets waterfall down in that period due to it being the end fiscal calendar cycle

so i fully expect well see spx  again some point by then pharma and utilities are usually the best buys in decades when they hit that bottom while an already recovering market has began its climb and is retesting the week

so if anyones interested in pharma id star watching but not buying yet",0,"ctxr Brown & Brown, Inc. (BRO) fucking ctxr been riding the spikes from between  oast two years but now im intent on holding till it breaches",thanks for this info i never noticed this,from the genius who posted this

Economic indicators,StockMarket,"I used AI, behavioural economics and alternative data to create a stock market indicator","for the past couple of months iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been working on a bellwether indicator for the stock market i used insights from behavioral economics an alternative dataset and ai to turn this in to practice below i worked out the thought process behind the indicator which i wanted to share and bounce ideas off

xb

 the thought proces behind the indicator is divided in to the three components already mentioned a behavioural psychology part an alternative big data part and the ai part or just scroll down to see the final result compared to the sp 

the psychology part

the fact that you are more cautious when you just witnessed an accident is called availability bias in the school of behavioural finance it describes the notion that people judge the probability of something happening more likely when an example more easily comes to mind so for example you probably overestimate the probability of a shark attack when you have just read about in the news you could argue that the same goes for economic principles people are more likely to believe inflation is coming when the news is full of it or that a recession is coming when everyone is tweeting about it or that a stock is going up when its all over reddit point is that news can drive the market rather than just report or follow on it in this respect also the recent work of nobel prize winner robert shiller is relevant his book narrative economics describes how stories can propel economic events but how can one assess what people are reading or what news they are exposed to this is where alternative data and ai play their part

the alternative data part

traditional finance data is usually nice to work with it is clean nicely structured and most data is readily available unfortunately that is also its drawback since everyone is looking at it it is hard to gain an edge alternative data however usually is instructed and messy but it is unique one of the largest alternative data sources is the internet terabytes of data are generated every minute and with this indicator we want to take advantage of that

therefore i created a dataset with financial news articles from well know websites financial tweets and other sources of financial news combined to one large dataset with unstructured alternative data with this data we can see to what news investors are exposed to and here is the cool thing if we think about our behavioural flaws discussed in the first part we can make a prediction as to where investors availability bias is headed to put differently is we know if investors are reading more negative or positive news we can try to predict if their investment decisions will be positive ie long or if they will be negative ie short unfortunately going through all this data and seeing for every news article tweet etc whether its positive or negative is quite undoable but here is the good news we can let a computer do that and that is where the ai part comes in

the ai part

ai is getting smarter and smarter almost daily it seems and more importantly big ai libraries are available to everyone with a computer running python google tensorflow and facebook pytorch are so kind to make their ai libraries open source which puts some really powerful tools at the tips of your fingers in this case we will let ai do two tasks

 read headlines ml zero shot sentiment classification

 predict returns over a certain horizon

for this paper we will only discuss the first task the next one is for another post

to summarize the first two steps first we discussed how people are influenced by what they read second we showed that with alternative data we obtain what they read the next and hardest part is actually reading and classifying since we have about  daily news articles we have to let a computer to this which we do by means of aimachine learning we can use a model that is trained to classify a string of text as either optimistic scoring it with a max of  to pessimistic scoring it with a minimum of  how we do this is quite technical and will be explained in a different post but the end result is a dataset of more than a million articles classified from  optimistic to  pessimistic now the final step checking whether the theory we proposed in the first part holds any truth when checking the data

tying it all together

so to recap academic research shows how news can influence investor sentiment we have alternative big data that contains all this news and we have a computer that can interpret that news faster than any human can you can check out how this graphically looks on 



xb

the dashed line shows the sp the other one our sentiment indicator the vertical axis shows sentiment negative to positive and the horizontal axis is time you can clearly see how sentiment was already decreasing before the market collapsed under covid fear interestingly you also sentiment improving before the market recovered so at the least we can see from that this plot that there is a relation between our indicator and sp stock prices this shows how new technology and improvement in ai is giving us a new way for looking at the market",620,"people are more likely to believe inflation is coming when the news is full of it or that a recession is coming when everyone is tweeting about it or that a stock is going up when its all over reddit 

you may want to do a deeper dive on the who behind the tweets and posts just because people are talking about something doesnt mean that they are intending for the stock to go that way  eg hyping up a stock when a big player is looking to cash out and conversely trashing a stock when a big player is trying to get in cheap you saw a lot of the former with a lot of the escalated messaging around the reddit meme stocks i cant say that this was nefarious agenda pushing or just the equivalent of the barber giving stock advice but the same holds true anyways social media gives everyone a voice with the false pretense of everyones voice requiring the same value

to your datasets

 structured finance data is your gold standard

 alternative datasets are fine but might impose a lot of noise due to variability then again not sure what kind of datasets youre working with here

 people tweeting and redditing this is a project in itself youre doing classification semantic analysis and content filtering and general analysis on account truthiness

finally correlation is one thing youre looking for causal the way the hft traders do this is intercept where the money is going and just assume that big money  big money already did the hard research part and they know something they basically let everyone else do the hard work and open up shop next door coughcoughburgerking

xb

finallynice work on putting the data together into a visual representation analysis and reporting is nice but where are the insights what do we take away from looking at the graph where are the ahatradeable moments on your graph",so it looks like there has been a recent sizable drop in sentiment so we could expect that there may be a drop in the sp soon,"have you traded using this information
if yes how well did that work"

trade,StockMarket,Hawley introduces Pelosi Act banning lawmakers from trading stocks,"sen josh hawley has introduced a bill that would ban members of congress from trading and owning stocks using the name of his legislation to take a jab at rep nancy pelosi

hawley on tuesday introduced the pelosi act  or the preventing elected leaders from owning securities and investments act  renewing a legislative push to curtail stock trading by lawmakers that has failed over the last few years

members of congress and their spouses shouldnt be using their position to get rich on the stock market hawley tweeted in announcing his bill

the gop senator previously introduced legislation last year seeking to ban lawmakers and their spouses from holding stocks or making new transactions while in office

the hill has reached out to pelosis office for comment

hawley like a number of other republicans has focused on the former speaker and her family in pushing to ban stock trading by members of congress

last year pelosis husband paul pelosi sold millions of dollars worth of shares of a computer chipmaker as the house prepared to vote on a bill focused on domestic chip manufacturing a spokesman for pelosi said at the time that he sold the shares at a loss

members of both parties signaled interest in legislation barring stock trades after thensen richard burr who at the time was chairman of the senate intelligence committee unloaded stocks at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic the securities and exchange commission recently closed a probe of his trading activities without taking action

lawmakers have yet to be able to come up with a plan that garners enough support from both sides of the aisle to get a bill through congress democrats in  scrapped a plan to vote on such legislation before the midterm elections even after pelosi reversed course and expressed openness to colleagues voting for stock trading reform

along with hawleys bill a bipartisan duo in the house has introduced a bill this year on the topic reps abigail spanberger and chip roy introduced the trust in congress act this month marking the third time the pair have introduced the legislation

source 

senator josh hawley has introduced a bill called pelosi act that would ban congress members from trading stocks do you think the bill will get enough votes to pass this time",3455,lawmakers should be limited to putting their money into broad market index funds so they actually have to prioritize the general economy rather than whatever company bribes them the most,should this be passed  yes  will it  no  especially not with a name like that  it will get shut down so fast,this is just smoke and mirrors both sides have gotten extremely rich by trading stocks do you think these same people will vote against the process that has made them all millionaires i doubt it
trade,StockMarket,"BREAKING: China & Brazil have agreed to trade in their own currencies, ditching the US dollar.","if more countries start to trade in their own currencies it could reduce the demand for the dollar this could lead to a weaker dollar

china and brazil have agreed to conduct their trade and financial transactions using their own currencies ditching the us dollar as an intermediary 

they will be exchanging yuan for reais and vice versa instead of going through the us dollar

this is part of chinas efforts to reduce its reliance on the us dollar as the worlds major reserve currency and to promote the use of its own currency the yuan

china is brazils biggest trading partner with twoway trade hitting over  billion last year

the deal is expected to reduce costs promote greater bilateral trade and facilitate investment 

china has similar currency deals with russia and pakistan

my personal opinion is that china does not have a transparent central banking system

the us dollar became the world reserve currency after world war ii when the us emerged as the worlds leading economic power

in  following the bretton woods agreement  nations agreed to adopt the us dollar as an official reserve currency

the us dollar is likely to remain the world reserve currency for the foreseeable future 

it is a stable and reliable currency and it is widely accepted around the world",1284,how much of this post was written by chatgpt,they will trade in their own currencies and then just exchange it for usd because they realize the currency they got is poop,"they are trading mud for dogshit if you have problem trusting the fed and the us government with usd good luck trusting winnie the pooh and the cccp with the yuan 

the reality is that today there is no alternative to the usd as a reserve currency the war in ukraine and china clamping down on entrepreneurs and going full  have clearly shown that the us is still firmly in power as the worlds military and more importantly here economic superpower eur and gbp are the closest reserves to usd but again the ineffectiveness of ecb  boe in raising rates has shown that the usd is still the leader by far 

i think there is a clear need for an alternative to the usd as the world has been rarely more polarized than today however there is no credible alternative yet gold bitcoin maybe but they are not a credible alternative today

and before some china bootlicker downvotes me  no i am not american nor i live in the us if you like the yuan i encourage you to get exposed to it by converting all your savings into yuan and trusting the cccp to have your future in their best interest"

 this report comes out at am est so before market open

do i think everything will crash tomorrow and all of our beloved penny stonks will turn our portfolios a deep red i would say its about a  chance in my opinion not too high but we definitely need to be aware of this economic event on friday

reason being the private Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) report came out on tuesday when i traded forex i used this as a clue as to how the nonfarm payroll report would go nonfarm payroll has a big impact on the usd and the overall market in general

the Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) national employment report measures levels of nonfarm private employment the report is based on the actual payroll data from about  million employees processed by the automatic data processing inc 

the estimates were mil new jobs in the private sector for july the report came out with  new jobs

to me this means that the nonfarm payroll report tomorrow is going to miss in a big way i also think the unemployment rate might be higher than expected tomorrow too in my opinion tomorrow will be a red day with some of these stocks potentially dropping 

however if the politicians come out tomorrow and announce the approval of the nd tendies package we will all be saved im expecting them to reach a deal monday or tuesday of next week though

plan accordingly and stay safe tomorrow we play defense",76,i thought the unemployment report came out today,i feel like in the next few weeks the number of robinhooders and retail investors is gonna tank a lot of college kids like me have started gamblevesting for fun during quarantine but thats gonna stop with school starting back up i know that i personally will not have the time for this in about two weeks,this is why i am always  cash if i need to i can average downup

Trading strategy,PennyStocks,Gap and Go Trading Strategy Guide,"gap trading is one of the most poplar ways to day trade because there are countless different gap trading strategies and gaps offer great trading opportunities every day one of the most popular ways to trade gaps is to look for and buy into what is known as a gap and go

before getting into the gap and go trading strategy itself i want to start from the basics and first explain what a gap in the stock market is a gap is pretty much exactly what it sounds like its an empty space on a stocks chart caused by a lack of trading activity this happens most commonly on a daily chart the reason for this is because daily charts generally do not show price action during extended hours trading PartnerRe Ltd. (PRE) market and after hours so when a stock makes a large move to the upside during extended hours it is known as a gap up and when a stock makes a large move down in extended hours it is known as a gap down companies generally will release news and press releases during extended hours which is almost always the cause of any major gap in either direction

 

many traders dont like the thought of trading gaps because they believe the stock has already made its move during extended hours and by trading it after the market open theyd be too late as someone that day trades fulltime and focusses primarily on trading small cap gap plays i can promise you that this is not true even though gaps have already made large moves they still offer the best day trade opportunities because of the increased volume and volatility that they typically come with

realistically the problem is that most new traders are not taught to trade gaps properly like i said there are many different ways to trade gaps both long and short each way of trading gaps will require different methods of analysis and enteringexiting the stock

regardless the first step in any gap trading strategy is to find gaps dont worry i make this part easy for you because i share a morning watchlist every morning during PartnerRe Ltd. (PRE) market with the largest gaps along with other important information such as the news headline that caused the gap the number of shares outstanding nearest support and nearest resistance levels 

after youve found the biggest gaps for the morning the next step is going to be to find which ones are most likely to gap and go since many stocks gap up and come straight back down this part of the gap trading strategy is very important after years of trading gaps myself the criteria below is what i look for when determining which stocks are more likely to gap and go of course like anything in the market this isnt going to lead to a gap and go  of the time but it should definitely keep you from buying into the worst performing gaps

 a strong catalyst a catalyst like a piece of news released by a company is most likely to be cause of any major gap the strength of that news often plays a big role in whether or not the stock is able to gap and go now theres no exact measurement for how strong a catalyst is but you definitely know that positive drugtreatment trial results is a much bigger deal than a minor product patent its also important to know what makes an earnings report strong because earnings are the cause of many gap both up and down

 no recent dilution dilution can be a big red flag for potential buyers and investors in its simplest form its essentially a large amount of added supply to the market unless there is some serious demand for the stock all of that additional supply will likely drive the stocks price down and will make it much more difficult for the stock to gap and go in my opinion no matter what type of trading strategy youre using you should always check a website like  or  to see if the company has recent diluted or done any offerings if you see a recent offering that stock is likely to be a better opportunity to shortsell than buy

 strong chart history history repeats itself you can often look at a stocks long term chart  year to  year to see how well it performed on other days that it has gapped up in the past a stock that is in a longterm downtrend and regularly comes straight back down after a gap up is much less likely to gap and go than a stock that is in a long term uptrend and held held onto gains from past gap United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) look for a bullish chart history for the highest probability of a gap and go

 

 limited nearby resistance if a stock has little or even no overhead resistance its going to be more likely to gap and go resistance levels are prices where a stock historically struggles to break above due to stronger supply selling than demand buying if there are multiple nearby levels of resistance those prices can get in the way and prevent a stock from continuing to run after a gap up while looking for nearby resistance i primary analyze the  and  minute chart to look for any resistance that was formed during PartnerRe Ltd. (PRE) market on the day of the gap up as well as the daily chart to find any major resistance levels from the past

those are the four main things that you want to se when analyzing gaps and looking for the next big gap and go again these four filters are going to lead to a huge gap and go  of time but they definitely wont lead you to buy into the worst performing gaps i hope this post gives you some insight on how you can strategically trade gaps and profit from the gap and go strategy

Trading strategy,PennyStocks,Penny stocks: definition and 4 trading strategies to master in 2023,"for traders in the stock market penny stocks are worth exploring due to their high volatility and potential for higher returns with less capital however it is important to note that penny stocks are not necessarily for longterm investors it is recommended for beginners to learn the fundamentals before trading penny stocks

 penny stocks definition

 the term penny stock usually refers to a small companys stock that costs  or less these stocks are often associated with the overthecounter exchange but some are traded on major exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) there have been many examples of penny stocks that have increased dramatically in value such as amc entertainment and nokia in  there are many opportunities for active investors to profit from cheap stocks that are experiencing significant growth 

 how to trade penny stocks

 the article discusses how trading penny stocks is different from trading larger market capitalization companies like apple and tesla shorter time horizons are typically used for penny stock trading but there is potential for longerterm investments the goal is to make money with penny stocks so learning different trading styles can be helpful the article explores various techniques that active traders use to make money with penny stocks 

 day trading 

 day trading involves buying and selling securities within the same trading day with the position being closed before the end of the day the rise of retail traders has led to more day trading liquidity in the market which is important for entering and exiting trades easily this is especially important for those using day trading strategies to make money in the stock market 

 scalping

 another type of trading strategy is scalping which is similar to day trading but involves buying and selling within a very short period to take advantage of small moves in share prices scalpers aim for frequent small gains rather than big ones and need high liquidity to quickly enter and exit trades 

 swing trading

 penny stocks can experience rapid price changes leading many retail traders to engage in day trading however some penny stocks continue to rise for days or even months and swing trading is a strategy used to take advantage of these opportunities unlike day traders swing traders actively seek out trades that can be held overnight this approach is popular among those who have other commitments and cannot monitor the market all day it is important to be aware that penny stocks can be volatile and unpredictable 

 companies can benefit from rising share prices by offering stocks at a discounted price through overnight financing deals with their banker swing traders need to be cautious and properly hedged because these offerings are not typically announced beforehand especially when dealing with penny stocks 

 momentum trading with penny stocks

 momentum trading can be used for penny stocks and involves using technical analysis tools such as trend lines and moving averages to identify stocks with strong price trends proper risk management and careful monitoring of positions are important due to the volatility of these stocks making timely decisions to enter and exit trades is crucial for success in this strategy 

 growth investing with penny stocks

 growth investing in penny stocks involves finding companies with great potential for growth in the future this approach requires analyzing the financial stability potential for growth competitive advantages and industry trends of the company this strategy can offer significant returns but it comes with higher risks due to investing in small and lessestablished companies having patience and a longterm perspective is crucial as the growth potential of penny stocks may take time to materialize

Trading strategy,PennyStocks,Do you have a trading strategy? Why not?,"i think this is a discussion that needs to be had i am a reasonably long time lurker of the sub and have definitely seen my share of profits from some of the tickers posted here please always do your own E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) no matter how hype a post may seem if its all positive it isnt real E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD)   


as some background i will admit that i am in a lucky position compared to most i recently sold one of my houses and ended up with a bit over k in liquid capital to play around with so i quit my job and took up trading full time after spending several months fulltime teaching myself the ins and outs  


i by no means claim to be an expert and as far as investing goes i am still pretty green but in my  monthsof active trading i am up over  and consistently trading a profit each week  


the biggest issue i see on this sub is that most people have jumped right into this about as recently as me but with little to no research or practice little to no understanding of the market or terminology and most importantly no trading strategy  


this is the big one and what i want to talk about because i am curious what  of this sub actually have a trading strategy they adhere too do you have profit margins stop losses risk margins how long do you hold your trades  


they say  of day traders lose money and can you be surprised when it seems nobody wants to spend any time developing a working strategy for themselves and instead just want to blindly gamble on stocks or follow the latest trend if trading purely on trend and credit post tickers was a way to consistently make money dont you think everyone would do it have some sense and think for yourself if you want to make money you need to figure out what works for you and implement consistently

you there holding all those bags and trying to slink away i see you dont ignore me

developing a personalised strategy  
i think the most important thing to any trading strategy is personalisation your strategy needs to suit you and your own mentality  capital what trading strategy works for me will almost definitely not be the same for you there will likely be similarities but thats the trick to ensuring you stick to your strategies having a touch of personalisation will make it feel like its yours your idea your strategy and as such you will be more inclined to stick to it psychology   


make sure when developing a trading strategy that you write it down on paper preferably then stick it somewhere you can see it constantly whenever you are about to openclose a trade look at your strategy and ask yourself am i following my strategy or am i acting emotionally if you are about to lock in a trade and it doesnt match your trading strategy its probably a bad trade and your past self is trying to warn you listen to these warnings to be profitable long term  


my personal tips  
dontt be greedy with your strategy set a reasonable and achievable goal to start with and make sure you can hit that goal consistently for several weeksmonths before altering a trading plan  


make sure your strategy has stop losses and profit targets in place this is massive give yourself a profit target be it    or more and stick to it if you are in a position and you hit your target take the profit and move on if you really want to continue with that stock wait for a dip and reapply your strategy with stop loss and profit target from your new entry point   
do not start ignoring your trading strategy for any reason as soon as you break the rule once you will do it again and your strategy is worthless  


my basic personal strategy take with a grain of salt develop your own it will be better  
risk  no more than  total capital per trade eg your total capital is  if you buy  shares   stop loss would be   
Protective Life Corporation (PL) target  profit loss target eg total capital  for each  stop loss have a profit target of   
time stop if a position fails to meet Protective Life Corporation (PL) target exit one week  
entry points  below mkt for buy  above for sell  
volume min day  
what works for me may not work for you but one thins is for sure you need something that works for you and you need to stick to it  


whats your trading strategy long term all in on gnus and wait today I learned the th sorry that isnt a strategy",16,if i think squiggly lines are gonna go up i buy calls if i think squiggly lines are gonna go down i buy puts,"thanks for that but
you have left out common sense factor i think its a huge part of the equation that some forget about for an example draftkings  my E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) is people love to gamble and people love sports  not going away anytime soon only E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) i need",dont have any specific trading strategy its kinda overrated to be honest i avoid pharmabiotech penny stocks because theyre all scams i dont buy into a pump if its already gone up over  i sell once i reach  or if it shoots high quickly i always sell the news well before it happens at least a day before

Trading strategy,PennyStocks,Profitable trading strategy,so there was a post made a few days ago mentioning that we should find these tickers faster so that we can get in cheap and sell while the fear of missing out wave is coming in since these tickers are found relatively late wouldnt it be more profitable to short a ticker thats posted here i know that shorting requires some type of margin and theres alot of risk but is that worth the reward,5,"i dont ever plan on trading with margin

the way i look at it is

would you go to the casino and gamble their money",limited upside massive downside especially with penny stocks unless you have enough margin or influence to affect the price yourself like hindenburg did,i would rather everyone get together and jump on a penny stock unfortunately  too many opinions and by the time you find the gnus or uone its already too late to get into it
Trading strategy,PennyStocks,Backtested VWAP Trading Strategy (including TradingView script),"today i want to share with you a tutorial including tradingview script for backtesting and live trading about a strategy that i have designed myself and that has been my bread and butter for many years

there is a link to the video tutorial including backtest results and tradingview script at the end of this post

this strategy is a swing trading strategy designed to catch larger swings in trending markets while filtering out ranges the strategy achieves high win rates of  and more across different assets it can be used for trading stocks futures and crypto

it uses the vwap  ema and  ema applied to the  hour or daily time frame the  and  ema are used to identify the trend direction and to filter out ranges together with the AptarGroup, Inc. (ATR)

when the  ema is above the  ema we are in an uptrend and when the  ema is below the  ema we are in a downtrend when the spread of the exponential moving averages is larger than the average true range multiplied with a discretionary factor we are in a trend and when it is smaller we are in a range this mechanism is used to filter the ranges

once we identified that we are in a trend we use the vwap to find a pullback and use that to enter into the direction of the trend

the take profit is set by multiplying the average true range with a discretionary factor for the stop loss the strategy uses a trailing stop loss

you can adjust all the parameters in the tradingview script and use it to run backtests or to get trade signals on different assets

i have created a video tutorial explaining how and why this strategy works in detail as well as how to use the accompanying tradingview script for backtesting and live trading



you can find the tradingview script linked in the video description",11,"does this submission fit our subreddit if it does please upvote this comment if it does not fit the subreddit please downvote this comment

Options trading,PennyStocks,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,"i want to preface this post by saying that i personally only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks with that being said i have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis if you already have a bit of experience with options this post may not be very beneficial to you because im just going to cover the basics of options how they work and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them

first and foremost what are options options are actually options when you buy an option contract you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a predetermined price up to a prespecified date if you decide to do this you are then exercising your options

there are two types of options that you can trade which are call options and put options call options or just calls allow the holder to buy at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock because of this your call options price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises put options or just puts allow the holder to sell at the predetermined price and are the options equivalent to shortselling the underlying stock because of this your put options price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines because one single option contract represent  shares of the underlying stock you would have  shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised

 

now the predetermined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contracts is known as the strike price when buying options you have to choose a strike price along with an expiration date which is the last day that your options can be exercised both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy because they greatly affect how the options will trade before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options its important to know a bit more general options information

as for strike prices there are really two main kinds in the money itm and out of the money otm itm and otm refer to the underlying stocks price in relation to the strike price of the contract calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered itm whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered otm on the other side of the spectrum since you want the stocks price to go down when you own puts your put options would be itm if the strike price is above the current stock price and otm if the strike price is below the current stock price

 

i know its a bit confusing if youre new to options to give an example if stock xyz was trading at  a call option with a strike price of  would be itm since the underlying stock is already above the strike price however since calls and puts are essentially opposite a put with a strike price of  would be an otm put in this scenario

whether an option is itm or otm has a big impact on how to option will trade the main reason for this is because all otm options are worthless at expiration this means that if you invested  by buying one call option at   x  your contract would be worth  if it was otm at the markets close on the expiration date and you would lose your full  investment because of this otm options are generally higher risk higher reward than itm options although itm wont be worthless at expiration like otm options they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay

time decay in options causes the price of the contracts also known as the premium to decrease as it gets closer to expiration this alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay so in order to profit from options you have to not only be right about the stocks direction but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay

time decay along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts are represented by what are known as greeks the greeks are theta vega delta and gamma like i said the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so im not going to go into a ton of detail on the greeks in this post but i do at least want to explain theta theta is the greek representing time decay in options you can see an options theta along with the other greeks before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay generally the theta will be higher for otm options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at  similarly theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches

theta makes general trading rules like dont fight the trend even more important for example if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support so in this situation youd be correct about the stock finding the bottom but you would still lose money if it didnt start to bounce back up quickly if you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options youd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support

 

although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades there is actually a way to have it work in your favor you can short options contracts which is also called writing just like with shorting stocks you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short in my opinion this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling

the reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts you would lose money as the options increase in price its the same reason that many people are afraid to shortsell stocks but options are generally more volatile which creates even more risk even though i wouldnt necessarily recommend it for beginners i wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post

regardless of how you trade options its important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced like any other type of trading you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options especially if youre trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time

maybe after this youll see why i stick to trading stocks rather than options they can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders but theyre much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns

hope this was helpful let me know what ya think",22,this is great thank you very much for taking the time to do this would love to read more about the greek terms,another amazing post this stuff is really great keep em coming,thanks for sharing i really enjoyed it

same old story out there on wednesday buy reopening sell high growthtech institutional sweepers continue to plow into inflationreflation leaders while the bulk of the put buying remains focused on etfs and growth

united airlines holdings incualus las vegas sands corplvsus boeing cobaus exxon mobil corpxomus oneok incokeus financials and travel leaders have been absolutely tattooed over the past couple of weeks

on the sentiment front

recent volatility hasnt had a noteworthy impact on intermediateterm sentiment yet but the selling has been in just half of the market so far

hedge funds spit up a bit trimming some of their recent long exposure after getting a bit more aggressive buying into this recent dip

institutions are still primarily focused on this reopening theme but continue to plow into the leaders for the most part there has been some recent activity in underbelly commodity plays like teck resources ltdteckus and amyris incamrsus yesterday but we havent seen many fresh names the most aggressive aspect of the flow has been in the more wellknown cyclical plays

that will change eventually theres still a potential drawdown risk across the board here because the more they hammer growth the higher the odds theyll need to sell winners as well to meet margin calls our best entry for swing positions will likely come off the selling where everything is highly correlated in other words when everything finally pulls back together with the indices and theres nowhere to hide this phase can come to an end

but when will that come no clue for now a tactical strategy remains the way to go they are not really showing much excitement in growth yet selectively dabbling for just a bounce",1,"does this submission fit our subreddit if it does please upvote this comment if it does not fit the subreddit please downvote this comment

Fundamental analysis,PennyStocks,Fundamental vs. Technical Analysis with Penny Stocks,"penny stocks offer substantial return potential with two main approaches fundamental analysis and technical analysis

fundamental analysis delves into a companys financial health operational efficiency and longterm potential it relies on concrete data from financial statements and earnings reports reducing the need for market speculation this approach is valuable for identifying undervalued penny stocks poised for longterm growth and assesses a companys competitive position within its industry

technical analysis is wellsuited for the fastpaced nature of penny stock trading it involves analyzing price patterns trends and trading volumes to capitalize on shortterm market movements visual representations using charts and technical indicators help identify optimal entry and exit points this approach encourages a proactive trading style particularly valuable in the volatile penny stock market where quick reactions to emerging trends can lead to profitable opportunities

both approaches have their merits and the choice depends on an investors goals risk tolerance and trading style a strong understanding of both methodologies coupled with disciplined application and risk management is crucial for success in the penny stock market

in conclusion neither fundamental nor technical analysis holds a definitive edge in trading penny stocks the choice between the two should align with the investors goals trading style and risk tolerance a clear understanding of both methodologies coupled with disciplined application and risk management is key to navigating the complexities of penny stock trading and achieving success in this challenging yet potentially rewarding market",5,"does this submission fit our subreddit if it does please upvote this comment if it does not fit the subreddit please downvote this comment

 secondly here are my longerterm price targets

 
 
 
 



so obviously those longerterm price targets would be amazing if they hit but those are probably very far away in the long term

for the chart here is what you are looking at

 an over sold rsi typically means due for a reversal
 a rocketing daily volume this typically signals a big move is coming
 beat down price action in my opinion we have a lot more potential for upside at this rate than downside
 the horizontal lines are support  resistance levels

my final thoughts

this stock is oversold and has massive upswing potential is this a guarantee no am i saying it will happen no do i think that at this point we have decent enough odds and good riskreward levels that it is at least worth looking into yes

Technical analysis,PennyStocks,How to use Technical Analysis when Trading Penny Stocks,"introduction

technical analysis is a key strategy used by traders particularly those dealing with penny stocks which are generally defined as stocks with a share price below  this method involves the study of statistical trends gathered from trading activity such as price movements and volume unlike fundamental analysis which focuses on a companys financial health and market position technical analysis is primarily concerned with patterns within stock charts believing that past trading activity can predict future price behavior

scalping and momentum trading

scalping is a strategy that can be especially useful in penny stock trading in scalping traders aim to take advantage of small price changes making frequent trades to accumulate profits this strategy is particularly effective in the penny stock market due to the inherent volatility of these lowpriced stocks technical analysis tools like macd and rsi can be useful here for instance a bullish macd crossover may signal a good opportunity for a scalp trade

momentum trading is another common strategy in penny stocks where traders aim to capture larger moves in the market this is often done by using trend following indicators such as moving averages for example when a stocks price crosses above its day moving average it can be a sign that the stocks momentum is turning bullish

swing trading and reversal patterns

swing trading is a strategy where traders aim to capture gains in a stock within an overnight hold to several weeks technical analysis is essential here as traders need to identify the start and end of price swings tools like fibonacci retracement levels can help identify potential support and resistance levels during these swings

additionally reversal patterns can be extremely important in penny stock trading double tops double bottoms head and shoulders  these are all patterns that can signal a reversal of trend recognizing these patterns early can help traders take advantage of price movements in the opposite direction

indicators and volume analysis

technical indicators play a crucial role in trading penny stocks providing you with insights into market trends momentum and potential reversal points below are some commonly used indicators and how they can be applied to penny stock trading

 relative strength index rsi the rsi is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements it moves between zero and  and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in the context of penny stocks an rsi above  may indicate an overbought condition and potential sell signal while an rsi below  may suggest an oversold condition and potential buy signal
 moving average convergence divergence macd the macd is a trendfollowing momentum indicator it shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securitys price the macd triggers technical signals when it crosses above to buy or below to sell its signal line the speed of crossovers is also taken as a signal of a market is overbought or oversold
 bollinger bands bollinger bands are a volatility indicator they consist of a middle band simple moving average and two outer bands that are  standard deviations away from the middle band when the price is near the upper band it could be seen as overbought and when its near the lower band it could be seen as oversold however a breakout from the bands can signal a continuation of the current trend

volume analysis

volume is another crucial component of technical analysis volume refers to the number of shares or contracts traded in a security or market during a given period high volume often means theres significant interest or activity in the stock and it can be a sign of the start of a new trend

in penny stocks a sudden increase in volume could indicate the start of a significant price movement this can be particularly useful for breakout strategies  if a penny stock breaks a key resistance level on high volume it could be a strong buy signal

conversely low volume can signal a lack of interest and could indicate a reversal is near particularly if the stock is at a key support or resistance level traders might use this as a sell signal or an opportunity to short the stock

conclusion

trading penny stocks with technical analysis requires a keen understanding of both the market behavior of these volatile securities and the precise application of technical analysis tools by employing strategies like scalping momentum trading swing trading and accurately identifying reversal patterns traders can potentially gain a significant edge in the market however its vital to remember that these strategies come with their own risks and proper risk management should always be a priority",44,"does this submission fit our subreddit if it does please upvote this comment if it does not fit the subreddit please downvote this comment

Risk management,PennyStocks,Need a penny stock risk management strategy? Top tips.,"top tips for creating a penny stocks risk management strategy

 penny stocks offer investors a chance to discover highpotential companies at their infancy stage despite being lesserknown investing in these smallcap stocks can lead to significant profits effective risk management is crucial for success in this lesserknown segment of the stock market 

 comprehensive research is crucial for informed decisions in penny stock investing successful investors scrutinize a companys fundamentals competitive positioning and management teams track record to assess growth potential and make informed investment decisions 

 diversified investment approach is essential for mitigating risk by spreading investments across multiple industries rather than focusing on a single company or sector this approach shields the portfolio from downturns in specific areas involving multiple sectors and industries 

 a strict exit strategy helps control potential losses and prevents emotions from steering investment decisions developing a systematic selling approach based on time or price movement prevents emotional influences and ensures a smooth exit process 

finally investing only what one can afford to lose serves as a golden rule in penny stock investing given the unpredictable nature of these stocks maintaining a level of investment that does not jeopardize overall financial stability is advisable 

by adopting these risk management strategies one can navigate the vibrant landscape of penny stocks unlocking potentially lucrative opportunities while keeping risk under control

  tips for making a proper penny stocks risk management strategy 

  understand the value of research 

diving into the world of penny stocks without proper research is akin to navigating unfamiliar waters without a compass one must understand that comprehensive research is not just beneficial but essential when considering these lowpriced highpotential investment opportunities this research becomes the foundation upon which successful investment decisions are made illuminating the path for those seeking to make substantial gains

decoding the business model of the company in which one plans to invest is a fundamental step having a grasp of the underlying mechanisms that drive the companys profits will allow investors to determine if the business has a sustainable model that can weather the various challenges that industries often face 

analyzing a companys competitive positioning and unique selling propositions is crucial for future growth potential the management teams track record and successful ventures can instill confidence in the penny stocks potential experienced leadership and successful ventures shape the companys strategic decisions and direction 

finally investors can benefit from reviewing the companys financials which are often accessible through public filings these documents offer valuable insight into the companys revenues debts and overall financial health

  utilize a diverse investment approach

in the dynamic world of investing in penny stocks a diverse investment approach can be the lighthouse that guides you through by diversifying investors can spread their risk across a multitude of sectors and industries increasing the possibility of capitalizing on market trends and counteracting potential downturns

the importance of sectoral diversification cannot be overstated an investment strategy that encompasses penny stocks from a variety of sectors allows you to take advantage of the unique growth opportunities each sector offers for example you might consider investing in a mix of technology healthcare and manufacturing penny stocks this way even if one sector experiences a slump the others could potentially buffer the impact 

geographical diversification another facet of a diverse investment approach can also provide an added layer of security by investing in penny stocks from companies operating in different regions or countries investors can mitigate risks associated with local economic fluctuations

 when using a diverse investment approach consider correlation noncorrelated penny stocks can optimize your portfolio by providing balance if one stocks price dips diversification is not a onesizefitsall strategy the best approach depends on individual financial goals risk tolerance and investment horizon riskaverse investors may prefer a conservative strategy while risktolerant investors may diversify more aggressively 

  strictly adhere to your exit strategy

venturing into the realm of penny stocks demands not only a comprehensive entry strategy but also a disciplined exit strategy this is where the saying plan your trade and trade your plan rings especially true an exit strategy is a predetermined plan that assists investors in defining when to sell their stocks and it serves as a crucial tool for managing potential losses and securing profits

when trading penny stocks a common exit strategy is setting a price target this involves determining a specific price at which you plan to sell the stock for a profit or alternatively to cut losses adhering strictly to this price target prevents emotional decisionmaking ensuring you remain rational and disciplined even when the market is turbulent 

timebased exit strategies are another valuable tool for penny stock investors this approach determines in advance how long you intend to hold a position if the stock doesnt reach your price target within this period you exit the position this can prevent holding onto stocks that are not performing as expected

 the trailing stop loss is a popular exit strategy that moves with the market ensuring profits are locked in and losses are limited this strategy is crucial for penny stocks as not every investment will yield a profit successful investors must adhere strictly to their exit strategy treating each loss as a learning opportunity",15,"does this submission fit our subreddit if it does please upvote this comment if it does not fit the subreddit please downvote this comment

Risk management,PennyStocks,How do you deal with risk management in red market?,"hi everyone

when i buy a stock and already defined my risks upon entry and the next day some bad news happen and market goes red 

now when i entered the stock i choose the entry price based on risk management whether entry was above support or not

but because of red day it can break that support that doesnt mean my entry was wrong but the whole market is down therefore this stock goes down with the others

xb

so now on the red day do you adjust your risks or stay on the same risk decisions when you entered the stock

i hope i explained my question very well

i appreciate your views on this matter since its confusing me",1,whenever theres a day full of red i just go for a walk in the nearest park so i can scout for a good spot if i ever became homeless,you might bet a better answer at rdaytrading however i dont trade right away when the market opens i usually wait for it to settle down a little bit  hours,nan

 put in the price you bought the stock
 put in how many shares you bought
 it calculates the total price

 you pick a price youd like to sell the stock at
 it calculates how many shares you need to sell to cover your costs
 shows you how many shares will be pure profit shares no matter what happens to the stock price after youve sold at your target price

you can always put a stop loss or trailing stop loss as your safety net to potentially make more money or you can also use this method if you know youre a fear of missing out chaser and dont know when to sell haha good luck everyone",102,i did the exact same thing recently will definitely use this tho,what if you buy a stock and the price goes down,awesome thanks been meaning to do something similar in excel

 how to trade in this market

if you guys are familiar with my trading style you know i use a lot of strict risk management in my position sizing and the way the market has been this month is exactly why i do it currently on the month im  but i have definitely lost more trades than iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) won its why i use  riskreward no matter what i can lose more trades than i win and still be even  if you buy a stock right now you need to have a stop loss and only risk whichever percentage of your account that youre comfortable with in my opinion i only risk  of my account per trade and cut my losses at that level each time

xb

 basically im not buying any pennystocks right now

im watching visl acco bhat not too much though gnus and others but im not buying any stocks or pennystocks while i think spy is bearish im only day trading spy options and swing trading sqqq long position 

if you buy any pennystocks i would just tread lightly or plan on day trading for a while im still bearish on spy down to  but maybe april will be bullish again for the market today I learned then just have to trade lightly and not hold any options overnight while managing my sqqq swing

just some reminders

youre a great investor 

youve been profitable in other months

you will continue to be profitable once the market is bullish again

 stg gapping up but couldnt find a catalyst momentum from yesterday seeing good volume and price action in the premarket if it dips below  then its showing weakness and there will be better opportunities elsewhere unless it can get back up to  level after the dip but ill be keeping an eye on it to see if it can maintain that level
 fedu gapping up on momentum from yesterday seeing decent volume with pretty good price action in the premarket premarket resistance at  with support around  low float so this could see some volatile swings just have an exit plan when you take a trade but dont go chasing trades

 the influence of the debt ceiling on the stock market

another significant factor influencing the stock market is the ongoing negotiations in washington dc to raise the debt ceiling the debt ceiling which is the maximum amount of debt that the us government can incur has been a contentious issue in recent years with disagreements over the ceiling leading to government shutdowns and market volatility 

the tentative agreement to suspend the debt ceiling until june  if approved by congress will allow the us government to pay its bills and avoid a technical default this development has been seen as removing a potential catastrophic negative from the market allowing investors to focus on other factors  

 the future of the stock market

despite the mixed performance the markets future trajectory remains uncertain factors such as the federal reserves next move the outcome of the debt ceiling negotiations and the continued interest in ai will likely play a significant role in shaping the markets future

investors particularly those interested in penny stocks should keep a close eye on these developments understanding these influences and trends will be crucial in making informed investment decisions",9,"does this submission fit our subreddit if it does please upvote this comment if it does not fit the subreddit please downvote this comment

Market trends,PennyStocks,"$WPG could make a major move this week- Squeeze factors, Chart factors, Market trend factors, comparables, and more","overview  washington prime group

wpg has a very large short percentage momentum positive economic news  it was trading near all time lows from an exaggerated pandemic push down that is now being lifted as real estate is priced at all time highs and demand is rapidly increasing  there is a  upside gap to fill even without accounting for the fact that the assets should actually be worth more than they were at the time the prior prices existed



 short squeeze  fast upward movement factors

over  short as of friday

low  million share float

volume has been extremely high compared to the average yet shorts have failed to push it down starting with  million june st and ending with  million on friday june th

the vast majority of shorts underwater the chart is curling now   every time shorts tried to push it back down the price bounced back which makes their situation worse

when a move up doesnt correct back down in the face of volume and shorting shorts must cover or be margin called

with shorts already underwater any gap up or move at open will cause immediate covering and stop loss triggers  shorts may even have to convert to longs to recoup losses as the price spikes



 similar squeezes

iht rhe aht and others have capitalized on the economy finally opening up and shorts getting caught off guard

the short percentage of iht and rhe are comparable to wpg and look how they moved

iht and rhe dont have the huge gaps to fill that wpg has but they have gone parabolic on low floats

aht has a much larger float than wpg which limits its ability to run as wpg can



 chart and technical factors

the pandemic caused the price to drop in an exaggerated way that left major gaps to fill  in fact the gaps to fill are huge with the Post Properties, Inc. (PPS) being at  in late  prepandemic and over  in early 

the past stock prices dont even account for the increase in real estate value overall that weve seen with supply being at lows and demand being very high  wpg has prime real estate in its reit

when it breaks resistance it can sprint up dollars at a time  for example breaking  in the past has led to a move above  very quickly

the initial  million share move only barely went down and curled back up into friday

bullish after hours trading occurred friday indicating the sentiment for the coming week there should have been profit taking on a friday that causes a dip but it didnt happen  strength seems to be growing

volume has remained strong through the week with shorting having no successful effect on the price

resistance levels are rising

the macd rsi and other technical measure cooled off as needed while maintaining a strong price and curling up against short pressure  nonoverextended technicals are an important factor to allow the next leg up next week to go  plus and still have room

xb



 quality of wpg

blackrock vanguard charles swab and other major players are invested in this  wpg is not some speculative trash stock without real intrinsic value or interest

they have property in major metropolitan areas across the entire us with quality tenants including home goods aurora macys and more  they are adapting to new consumer trends and earning new forms of income for entertainment experiences to replace any shopping facilities that became vacant  the value of location cannot be replaced and tenants are paying for that



 industry momentum

retail real estate is filling vacancies quickly even redeveloping for a new generation of shoppers with new types of entertainment sports and dining experiences  for example 

real estate prices are at all time highs if you havent noticed and that gives owners like wpg leverage to sell or repurpose parcels read parking lots that can become parking garages

mall retailers are having record sales which can mean higher and more reliable rent 







wpg spun off from simon and this is what simon says  

new leasing is coming in  

reits are adjusting to a new life style  during covid tenants had to leave but now many places are renting at  and accelerating in growth because there are bars eateries games sports family activities etc moving in  location is king and quality reits have it",15,"does this submission fit our subreddit if it does please upvote this comment if it does not fit the subreddit please downvote this comment

Market trends,PennyStocks,NASDAQ: $TNXP - Tonix Pharmaceuticals A COVID pennystock with an actual pipeline and potential for 10-15$/ or 500%-1000% gains. AND with Institutions loading up DD,"iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen a lot of post talking about tnxp lately and some people iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen have wanted initial E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) so here it goes

 taken directly from their website

tonix pharmaceuticals holding corp National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) tnxp tonix is a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company committed to discovering and developing innovative and proprietary new therapeutics that address the needs of patients we focus on developing small molecules and biologics to treat cns pain neurology psychiatry addiction and immunological vaccines immunosuppression oncology autoimmune disease conditions

their pipeline of drugs



tnx  a fibromyalgia drug in phase  trials that already had positive results in its first part of its phase three trials yes fibromyalgia and the stock is still under  with a market cap of under a billion now how much is fibromyalgia worth  see for yourself 

for those too lazy to click the link its estimated to be worth  billion oh yeah and theres less than three drugs specifically used to treat fibromyalgia approved on the open market by the fda

tnx  used for the prevention and treatment of organ rejection also they are working with mass general hospital on this 

tnx  sl for alzheimers



remember tnx  from earlier the improved sleep quality seen in earlier clinical trials of tnx sl for other disorders suggests tnx sl could potentially be an effective treatment for agitation in alzheimers disease currently there are no fdaapproved treatments for aad despite a high disease burden and a need for an effective therapy tnx sl for the treatment of aad has been designated by the fda a fast track development program designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need yes fda fasttrack worth  billion 

so you wanna hear bout them covid vaccines and projects 

vaccine

 this quarter they will presumably be done with monkey trials and will move onto human trials tnx is being developed by tonix pharmaceuticals in a strategic collaboration with southern research a respected research organization developing with them also they already talkedreleased some about positive results this also uses tcells meaning anyone could basically get this vaccine that guy fauchi talks a lot about tcells just saying

 they also have been working a little bit with fujifilm

buying two big facilities for vaccines outright



skin test for covid



institutions loading up through offerings

 million shares at  cents  generating  million

 million shares at  that closes after hours today generating  million

before this they had around  million banked looking at the last quarter add the new two fundingofferings that means they  million in cash

after these offerings the share float will be a little over  million assuming the institutions didnt flip for pennies this means they own essentially a little under  of the stock

edit i almost forgot in  or  days it will regain National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) compliance as well

i got in last year for  shares   unfortunately i dont have the funds to buy more i hope this answered your questions ladies and gentleman about tnxp get in while its still low and happy trading and good luck out there lets all make some money",3745,"does this submission fit our subreddit if it does please upvote this comment if it does not fit the subreddit please downvote this comment

if you have any questions or concerns","a useful barometer for how much of a chance something has for diluting offering new shares is gonna be eps and management history practices earning vs burning 

positive eps shows a company that is profitable and able to run with minimal risk or need to raise money by offering and selling new shares an example of this would be sach positive earnings low risk of dilution etc they even pay out quarterly dividends and have ok cashflow from catering to fixnflip and loan sharking also is an reit

a money burner example is muln eps of negative  dollars per share showing extreme risk of further dilution and Reliance Steel & Aluminum Company (RS) etc etc with millions of shares that means they are bleeding money very very very fast

this site can help you see what the majority of the  are investing in

   do not sign up for the service you can easily browse it for free

xb

now some people believe that you need to learn harmonic patterns and candle patterns and all this other shit its beneficial for you to learn it i will agree on that however we are in the age of the world where technology can do all that basic shit for you

heres an example of an indicator showing me simple bearbull abcd patterns



need to know the support and resistances of a stock  guess what a simple indicator can easily do that for you



you can literally find or create an indicator for any of your needs youll hear people that say all you need is rsi and macd  those people have never looked at any other indicators in my opinion considering there are ones that have been made that are way more accurate than both

xb

now what if you dont have tos and only want to use webull  well thankfully webull has a few indicators built in that you can use that will help you

although i hate regular macd you can still use it to hopefully avoid being cucked in a trade



im sure with the above picture you can see how you could get cucked get in at the wrong time and could end bad get out at the wrong time and it could be even worse macd is a lagging indicator which is why people pair it with rsi leading indicator



you can see the benefit and drawback of it from the above picture

xb

now imagine using something like this indicator that most people overlook



if you were playing contractsoptions you could have easily bought a c for this upcoming week for under  and sold it for over 

my recommendation for anyone who is actually reading this shit learn to use indicators every indicator has a set of rules that can differ for the time frame that its set on this shit can save you a lot of time and money rsi and macd are literally the most basic ones dont be a fool and blindly follow only those indicators when there could be others that are much more suited to your needs

edit changed the last sentence  brought to my attention how confusing it was also you can customize the macd to act differently depending on the periodsdays

edit heres one of the websites i used to find a few of the indicators that i use there is another that im trying to recall will update in the morning with it",752,great resource,curious why this community doesnt seem to be a fan of etrade in general in my opinion its a way more robust and stable platform than web bull and robin hood  why is everyone so drawn to those platforms,awesome list thanks for taking the time to put this together

Economic indicators,PennyStocks,"OMID's Stock Performance: A Day of Decline and Stability - July 24, 2023","xb



xb



on july   omids stock opened the trading day at  mirroring the closing price of the previous session the stock reached its daily high at the opening price but retreated to a low of  before settling at a closing price of  this day was marked by a lower trading volume of  shares of which  were short volume

 a subdued day on the market

july  saw omids stock opening at  immediately hitting its daily high before a downward movement led the stock to a low of  this decline might have been driven by various factors ranging from market sentiment to broader economic indicators or companyspecific news regardless of the cause its important to note that such market fluctuations are a routine part of investing in equities

 moderate trading activity

one notable aspect of the days trading was the relatively moderate trading volume of  shares a significant reduction from the previous session this decrease suggests a lower level of investor activity and could potentially indicate a waitandsee attitude among traders who might be observing the market dynamics before deciding their next moves

 short volume and its implications

another element worth highlighting is the short volume of  shares the presence of short selling where investors bet on a stocks price decline could signal anticipation of a downward price movement among some traders however its crucial to remember that short selling is just one facet of market activity and doesnt always foretell a definitive trend

 closing price and moving forward

despite the decline witnessed during the trading session omids  stock managed to recover part of its losses closing at  this  recovery from the days low may suggest that while some investors were  selling others saw potential value at the lower price and stepped in to  purchase the stock

 conclusion calm amid the decline

the trading session on july   served as a reminder that the  stock market isnt always about swift price movements or high volumes  some days like this one for omid present a picture of calm and  stability even amid a price decline

these seemingly less eventful days are as vital to the overall market  narrative as those marked by extreme volatility or high trading  activity they serve to balance the stock markets rhythm and offer  insights that can be useful in shaping investment strategies

preamble one of the main questions that i had and i see recurring on this sub is how to identify and invest in emerging stocks before it becomes mainstream news i did not have the time to actively track social media and decided to build a program that does it for me

how does it work the program is built using python and uses both twitter and reddit api to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth i added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative

core product

mindmed is in the field of developing psychedelicbased medications and treatments for neurological and mental health disorders the company is in a very early stage founded in  but is backed by famous investors such as bruce linton founder canopy growth and kevin oleary shark tank

they have  main products in the pipeline

i Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (MC) the optimism around mindmed is primarily due to the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (MC) drug which shows promising results in treating alcohol drug and nicotine addiction Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (MC) is currently in phase  of clinical trials for opioid addiction

ii project lucy this is a commercial drug based on microdosing lsd by a therapist to treat anxiety disorders and adult adhd currently on phase  clinical trial

iii digital therapeutics mindmed is betting on digital therapeutics as the future for their drug delivery by creating a platform aimed at delivering psychedelic based treatments and therapies in combination with digital therapeutics

xb



financials

the company has raised approximately m since its inception Swiss Exchange (SIX) rounds mindmed raised m in jan increasing their cash in hand to a healthy m the company is planning to use the proceeds from the latest fundraising to project lucy and Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD). (MC)

there isnt much sense in talking about revenue and Protective Life Corporation (PL) as this is a very earlystage biotech company that by nature cannot generate any significant revenue until their drugs get approval but the company had a sustainable burn rate and had a net loss of m in the quarter ending sep

potential and hype factor

the buzz is generated primarily due to the following reasons

National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) uplisting is one of the major catalysts in the increasing discussion the company is currently listed in neo and have applied to be listed in National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) which will significantly add to the liquidity expected in q

adding to this mindmed has multiple products in its pipeline the company currently has  major products which are in phase  of clinical trial which significantly derisk the companys future as you are not betting on one single product getting fda approval

inline with the digital therapeutics aim of the company mindmed acquired healthmode a digital therapeutics startup that uses ai and ml to increase the precision and speed of clinical research and patient monitoring allstock deal

risk and competition

there is definitely a significant risk associated with investing in smallcap stocks the main risk factors for mindmed that i could see are

a drug approval this is the simplest and would have the most impact on the companys future if none of the drugs in the companys pipeline get approval from fda the company would go under

b ability to raise funds since mindmed is an earlystage biotech startup the company would make no revenue for the foreseeable future  therefore the ability of the company in raising funds outpacing its burn rate is critical

c acceptance for psychedelic drugs although growing currently the acceptance for psychedelic drug is very low mindmed has an uphill battle in convincing the masses about the efficacy of its drugs

conclusion

there is currently a b global total addressable market for psychedelics even though there are significant risks interms of psychedelic drug acceptance and fda drug approval mindmed currently offers the broadest and most diversified pipeline of psychedelic drugs in clinical development this along with their ability to raise funds puts them in a very strong position

stock,PennyStocks,$CTRM DD Huge Value Stock,"about ctrm

castor maritime Suncor Energy (Inc.)ctrm is a global shipping company specializing in the ownership of drybulk vessels

it was first admitted to the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) in the month of february  at a share price of usd it has grew steadily reaching a high of  at a point

it invested heavily in the emerging seaborne shipping markets early in  however due to the economic fallout of the covid pandemic it fell to an alltime low of 

this is also partly due to the covid restrictions set on the seaborne shipping industry which accounts for almost  of ctrms trading volume

 why you should invest in ctrm

with the new vaccine rollouts covids end is in sight and the seaborne shipping industry is well positioned for a comeback

ctrm recently acquired new drybulk vessels and is aggressively expanding and by improving their fleet and increasing their market share

ctrms share price has been steadily increasing the high beta ratio of  can be highly attributed to the sharp decline in price due to the reasons mentioned before

president biden has signaled his willingness to address climate change and the drybulk vessels that ctrm is using have a lower carbon footprint this means that while other shipping companies are consolidating ctrm can continue its aggressive expansion

 financial statement analysis

ctrms financial statements are pulled from yahoo finances

xb



ctrms gross profit can be seen to be steadily increasing over the years this is due to the constant increase in the revenue to the company

ctrms pretax income has been increasing from  to  however it is having a loss this year this is partly due to the covid restrictions and its acquisition of the new drybulk shipping vessels

ctrms net interest income has drastically increased from  this means that they have paid back a lot of their debts and is deleveraged this reduced the risk of the company as a whole and the shares of ctrm

from the financial statement as a whole we can see the effects of ctrms aggressive expansion with the increased expenses overall and the rewards of it with its increased profits

 conclusion

the seaborne shipping industry is poised to make a great comeback at the end of covid and ctrm is at the head of it in the industry itself ctrm also has an advantage over other companies due to its low carbon footprint vessels with a current share price of  to  it is a good buy and i predict that it will hit at least  soon and  at the end of covid although it is currently not a large company its continued aggressive expansion will soon put it as a force to be reckoned with

for new or young investors

a swing trade is when something is severely tanking usually around  on the announcing of an offering the price normally tanks towards or near the offering price in this case that price is  a direct offering is better than a public offering because public offerings dilute shares however the public offerings are still viable swing plays in this case it is a public offering the object is to get in at or around the offering price and wait for the correction of the stock back to its price before it was oversold this is a genuinely easy way to watch your portfolio grow by  it may take a couple of weeks

i have purchased stock in an undervalued company  i have a fair value price target of  per share  the stock is currently trading at  per share  as is the case with an undervalued company and especially smallmid cap companies there can be increased volatility  from a value investing standpoint is it taboo to attempt to buy and sell during local minima and maxima along the way to the expected fair value of  a share  is this practice considered too much speculation on the part of a value investor  im aware of the risks from all possibly scenarios i would just like to get an opinion from those more knowledgable  i realize this practice becomes much more risky the closer one would get to a perceived fair value due to increased downside but is it taboo altogether  or is it increasingly more taboo as the risk involved is increased  im not looking for a general investing answer because i realize that there are a million investingtrading strategies out there as i am looking to become an unemotional disciplined value investor im essentially asking if this practice is bad with that goal in mind and if sohow bad

as always thanks for the help and comments",5,its not worth the money cause youd be paying a lot of commission fees every time you buy and sell the stock in addition if you dont hold on to a stock for more than a year any gain on that will be taxed at a higher rate these two factors will probably corrode your earnings so bad you might end up with less than if you just stuck to buy and hold,"ill add that you have to be right very often to make the more active strategy pay off  if you just let it ride in addition to the lower frictional trading costs and lower taxes you only have to be right  time

theres nothing that says you cant do it it just seems like a lot of work for little to potentially negative returns  if youre good enough at trading the squiggles you might want to just do that

if youre looking to generate extra returns from your investment covered calls are probably a better addition to a value investing strategy

edit  there are no taboos and no style points awarded  well maybe the only taboo is getting into something that you dont understand","the biggest flaw is that you dont know when the maxima or minima will be hit your thesis is stating that you think it should be valued at  how do you know if it drops to a  one day and for some reason it bounces back up to  and the market corrects itself 

i have noticed that the stock market is pretty quick at recognizing fair value once it is known market opportunities can exist for less than a week and then the gap closes just take a look at netflix it dropped from  to  in a week and within a week bounced back to over  not to say netflix was underoverfairly valued but just think about that"
Trading strategy,SecurityAnalysis,MicroStrategy (MSTR) Short Thesis,"summary

 mstr core business revenue facing sixth straight year of decline
 speculating with bitcoin does not solve revenue problems
 switched treasury reserve from cash to bitcoin making three substantial purchases of bitcoin over the last four months
 recently announced offering of  million unsecured convertible senior notes intended to finance purchase of more bitcoin

background

there are times when companies are overvalued due to promise potential predictions etc this often makes sense as we often say that you invest on potential not past there are also times where companies are overvalued due to hype and without much promise microstrategy seems to be the latter nasdaqmstr

let me paint a picture for you you are a global enterprise software company that has been successful for decades but in the last  years you have watched your platform and revenues begin to decline despite the global market you partake in nearly doubling your platform and product has been top in class for over a decade but your revenues cannot seem to keep up with market growth you are in a good position in terms of debt to equity and have a good sized cash position with roughly  million in cash you have ample opportunity to overhaul your product and do some rd and attempt to improve your bottom line what do you do

buying bitcoin does not make you an expert at bitcoin

mstrs management decided that the best plan of action would be to pivot into the business of bitcoin yes a global enterprise software company is now a bitcoin company and they are not employing bitcoin engineers or mining bitcoin or anything of that nature but are simply converting their treasury reserves into highly volatile bitcoin

microstrategy CNOOC Limited (CEO) michael j saylor said microstrategy has recognized bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset that can be superior to cash and accordingly has made bitcoin the principal holding in its treasury reserve strategy

for everyone out there who thinks that bitcoin is a great treasury reserve and loves this move we understand that there are definitely arguments that can be made for and against this move but one of the first questions we asked was did mstr management just wake up one day back in august and decide that they were qualified to speculate in bitcoin with virtually their entire cash balance and do they have any idea what they are doing

our thesis is no they do not know what they are doing and here are a few reasons we think mstr is overvalued at current prices

side note mstr is joined by sq nysesq and sri nysesri as companies converting part or all of their treasury reserves to bitcoin over the last several months

current numbers

mstr invested roughly  million into bitcoin over three transactions taking place in august september and december below is how shareholders are currently exposed to this investment on august  the day before their initial purchase mstr was trading at a market cap valuation of  billion as of december  they are now trading at a market cap valuation of  billion they went from trading around share to  share a  billion increase in market cap valuation credited due to an increase in their bitcoin investment value

since peaking in  revenue has been declining year over year and with estimates of mm and mm for fy and fy this trend is not predicted to change

pe ps who cares we realize it is not  anymore and that the price to earnings ratio does not carry the clout in todays market that it once did but mstr pe is currently spiking at  nearly x its year average of x in comparison the us software industry carries an average pe of x while us stocks currently carry a pe of x mstr is extremely overvalued based on this number

the same can be said about their price to sales ratio the us software industry carries an average ps x and prior to their bitcoin purchase mstr had a ps of x today that has doubled to x since the first announcement of their initial bitcoin purchase

tender offer

in mid september mstr executed a modified dutch auction to buyback shares at up to share they ended up repurchasing  shares at an aggregate cost of  million

we had to read the following headline several times to believe it

microstrategy completes  million offering of  convertible senior notes due 

first we want to acknowledge that these terms are friendly towards microstrategy the actual terms of the convertible debt do not bother us what bothers us is the reason behind the raise

these notes are convertible to  shares of mstr class a common stock per  principal amount of notes this is a conversion price of approximately share more than a  premium to where mstr last traded

mstr an enterprise software company just took on  million in new debt to finance the purchase of more bitcoin assuming they use these proceeds exclusively to purchase more bitcoin mstr would have roughly  billion in bitcoin the current market cap of total bitcoin sits around  billion

at current market cap  bil an investor looking for bitcoin exposure through microstrategy is entering as if the treasury bitcoin has increased by share or over x the actual change in bitcoin

fair valuation

based on the tender offer the market accepted  as a fair valuation of operating assets which included the mm in cash

mm of their current assets transitioned to bitcoin which is now worth mm for a gain of mm

translating to per share this gain equates to share

so for mstr stock price to properly account for markets expectations for their underlying business and actual growth in mstrs btc position it should be priced at 

the new debt offering further reduces this valuation due to significantly increased leverage risk these new senior debt holders will be the first in line to get paid from this mm investment in new bitcoin and possibly part or all of the existing bitcoin position if bitcoin drops below the purchase price equity holders will only see any value from this offering if bitcoin is above the purchase price at maturity

could mstr just be ahead of a new normal  was the last time bitcoin dominated the headlines and really spiked the back half of  is seeing a similar trend what if mstr is just ahead of the market what if they actually are some of the smartest people in the room and they are seeing value where others cannot grasp it what if the predictions of bitcoin reaching  million a coin by  come true we can what if this decision all we want and perhaps mstr is a future case in a class of  mba program the smartest ones on the street or what in the world were they thinking it is not fair to only mention the bad things that can happen regarding mstr they truly could be onto something here if bitcoin continues to thrive and grow and become a more normalized asset decreasing historical volatility etc then mstr could be an early adopter of a legitimate future normalized business asset class perhaps our  or even  mindset are blocking us from seeing the next generation and revolution of business although we do not think this is the case as of yet it is certainly a possibility

managing our position

we are not short shares of mstr but are long several puts our strikes range from  to  for the april  expiration we selected this expiration based on our belief that bitcoin is a cyclical volatile asset class that will continue to see substantial swings at current market cap  bil an investor looking for bitcoin exposure through microstrategy is entering as if the treasury bitcoin has increased by share or over x the actual change in bitcoin we believe the market will realize this and bring the price of mstr down so that it moves in lock step with the actual value of bitcoin we have targeted exit points at   and  profit targets based on our belief of mstr declining to its fair valuation over the next few months as bitcoin investment news fades and people realize the revenue and cash flow issues are real problems moving forward we also have a soft stop loss of roughly  which we believe gives us the time and wiggle room needed for our analysis to come to fruition

conclusion

microstrategy is significantly overvalued based on its current assets and business operations we feel that you are currently paying upwards of a  premium at current price levels and we feel that share is a fair valuation based on revenue growth and true value of their bitcoin investment this is not an ideal investment to get bitcoin exposure and microstrategy is not an investment firm we feel that they should be returning cash to investors not speculating on bitcoin with their treasury reserve we cannot predict how this experiment will play out but we can assert what we feel is a fair valuation time will tell

disclosure i amwe are short mstr

additional disclosure we are not short shares of mstr however we have initiated several long puts across multiple expirations and strikes

to provide a balanced viewpoint heres an interview with microstrategy CNOOC Limited (CEO) michael saylor on his perspective",97,good analysis however given the fact that this company has become a sort of bitcoin etf now the stock price will move very correlated to the asset if bitcoin continues its move a short position could be absolutely crushed i agree that the fundamentals of this company is very bad but as they say markets can remain irrational longer than u can remain solvent,"this guy crazy

Trading strategy,SecurityAnalysis,Darden Restaurants 2037 Bond,"this is going to be a short writeup mainly because i am lazy though if you have any questionscomments ill respond in appropriate depth

darden restaurants is a casual and fine dining operator with a portfolio of brands containing the following wellknown restaurants olive garden longhorn steakhouse cheddars scratch kitchen yard house capital grille seasons  bahama breeze and eddie vs with them just recently acquiring ruth christ

they are the largest company in their space though unlike their qsr peers they focus on expanding and investing companyowned and operated restaurants not on franchising though they do have franchisees as a result of acquired companies pursuing franchising it is a noncore focus and not part of their core strategy

for the next twelve months they should produce b in operating cash flow roughly or b in ebitda maintenance capex including replacing estimated stores that will close is m for the ntm with m in planned net restaurant expansion capex for  net stores to be added to its base of over 

they currently have besides operating leases which are already expensed in ebitda  debt profiles  bonds  bonds  bonds and  bonds along with a m term loan for its recent acquisition total b in longterm debt obligations excl associated interest they also have finance lease liabilities of b with m of interest in  fy ended may   making total interest expense mm for fy likely term loan is floating

ok now that we are done with the businessfinancial expose the thesis here is on the  bonds which over the last  years have been bought significantly in open market repurchases due to their high  coupon with the current amount left being m from the original m face value

though Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI) is bbb rated by spmoodys they are unreliable and with the bbb spread at BP p.l.c. (BP) to BP p.l.c. (BP) on treasuries these bonds should at surface level be trading for  to  ytm yet they are at a very attractive 

now lets go a bit deeper these bonds were issued in  and due to the company being half the size then and a bunch of acquisition occurring at once an amendment was added which in the case of credit downgrade below bbb the coupon could be increase up to  from  coupon but it cant go down below  where it is currently this offers a pretty nice safety net

the other important thing is that even though the credit rating agencies are rating them bbb rn they are full of crap the m floating rate y term loan issued for the ruth christ acquisition has a interest rate of any term sofr   a spread only given to companies rated Asco Plc Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS) (AAA) as of now the  bonds are also trading at  ytm or BP p.l.c. (BP) spread and  which are similar to the  in question at  ytm and the  at  ytm or BP p.l.c. (BP) spread

im not sure why the  bonds are trading at the highest spread of BP p.l.c. (BP) and their only unique nature is the credit deterrioration addition which is only a positive and with open market purchases and the noncallable nature liquidity is pretty acceptable it is probably liquidity tho but the  ytm was on august th and there is a couple of trades every few days so liquidity isnt bad especially for the m in remaining face value

i think a yield of  is an absolute steal for bonds of Asco Plc Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS) (AAA) company that is the only aggregator in its industry and has reliable cash flow with fcf of  for the ntm including growth capex equivalent to a fcfinterest coverage ratio of around xx",19,deleted,"i think the cyclical nature of the restaurant business is probably whats reflected in lower credit rating the agencies typically limit their ratings for cyclical industries 

typically anything less than m is pretty illiquid in the credit market and those eye popping yields are probably dealer gouging retail traders if you can actually buy at  then i think its a good trade",nan

Trading strategy,SecurityAnalysis,My first investment (finally!),"the stock


debenhams lsedeb of the many people i have spoken to both online and in real life about this only one person also agreed that it offered potential everyone else said that retail was dead debenhams was a terrible pick within a terrible market and that i was stupid i think therefore its safe to say iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) fully taken onboard mohnish pabrais advice in dhandho investor to buy distressed businesses in distressed industries


the investment merits as far as i am concerned are

	other uk bricks  mortar retailers going into administration is creating worry and depressing the stock prices of other retailers

	i believe that their business strategy to drive more footfall and cut excess footage by utilising space for gyms and restaurants is a very good idea

	there is a focus on beauty within the business an industry segment that is growing rapidly

	strong ecom growth and the CNOOC Limited (CEO) sergio bucher being examazon gives me confidence theyll continue to do well here

	the recent heavy discounting by other retailers including house of fraser hurting profit is likely to reduce now that house of fraser has found a buyer in mike ashley a  owner of debenhams the two chains are now less likely to commit mutually destructive acts additionally mike ashley is regarded as a great trader so having him as a prominent stakeholder is a plus

	low profit margin which can be useful in a turnaround business as a small increase in profit margin will have big a big impact on earnings

o	this is also a big risk if profit margin decreases further which is a real possibility if the pound continues to fall


the downsides

	earnings and cash flow have been decreasing for the last  years and this negative growth has accelerated in recent years

o	i believe that the new strategy of the business will begin to turn it around and that if earnings do not grow the stock is still so undervalued that the investment should still not lose money

	there is no discernible durable competitive advantage that stands them out from other big uk retailers

o	debenhams has good physical locations across the country and a growing online presence due to the relatively straightforward nature of retail they will be able to copy the strategy of other retailers if the concept is proved buchers strategy however is timeconsuming to implement and as they will be the first retailers to get a sense of whether or not it worked they will be in a good place to fully implement this before the arbitrage opportunity of having restaurantsgyms instore disappears

	the overall uk bricks and mortar retail sector is performing poorly and with the evergrowing ecommerce industry posing a huge threat there is a chance that a snowball effect takes place with high streets emptying resulting in lower footfall and causing more shops to go out of business

o	the strong ecom growth debenhams has shown means that if more and more consumers choose to buy their fashion online it should be able to grow sales further through this channel


the value

share price at purchase  p mkt cap  m

estimated earnings for yearend september   m m pbt  

ly basic eps  p

at a pe of  using estimated earnings  using ly earnings compared with a year median pe of  the stock is undervalued compared to its historic self and very undervalued compared to its peers

mike ashley paying m for a private company with a similar albeit a bit more highend offer to debenhams that is currently unprofitable and requiring a Danielson Holding Corporation (CVA) to continue trading suggests to me he would value debenhams at a lot more than m in fact he did value debenhams at significantly more than m when he built up his  stake

the analysts consensus of m earnings would give a profit margin of  assuming revenue stays constant with ly a  increase of profit margin would result in an  earnings growth whilst a return to the year median profit margin of  would yield  earnings growth

i currently believe the stock could easily climb to at least p if the companys strategy allows it to return to revenue growth even if this is not the case the astute trading mentality of mike ashley could hopefully provide similar results by increasing profit margin from its current alltime low



any feedbackcomments are very welcome

whilst many of you may disagree with the stock pick without the reading material supplied through this subreddit i wouldnt have had the confidence to take an independent viewpoint on it and certainly would not have put my money where my mouth is so whether you agree or disagree with the pick thanks for playing a part in helping me formulate my own investing opinions

edit feels like a lot of replies are that it doesnt make money because of the swaths of competition do you think this is true even in the face of small cap names which arent worth the time or effort of hedge funds",49,"too long; didn't read yes

as long as you realize that pure quant analysis and pure fundamental analysis are two sides of the same coin youll learn to sift through the threeblindmice style banter that im sure youve seen between supposed quants and buffheads there are absolutely merits to both approaches and the holy grail is to marry both of them

i used to work at a firm that strictly used quantitative trading signals based off of price and volume action so my thoughts here are limited to that type of approach the general basis for a lot of these strategies is that stock prices are a random walk around a drift term its imperative to isolate these random walks so that using gaussian distributionbased or other symmetrical statistical theory isnt that far off from the actual movements in the prices of securities the best way to achieve this is to trade on shortterm time frames this also holds up to the smelltest because changes in underlying fundamental factors that should ultimately alter the intrinsic value of a particular security dont change nearly as frequently or as violently as price movements alone would indicate and human behavior is emotional which leads to shortterm overreactions this is where quant firms find an edge assuming that the price movement of securities over shorter time horizons are overreactions or temporary mispricings based on almost no change in fundamentals

fundamental analysis takes the complete opposite view great value investors focus very intently on the drift term and tend to discount or ignore the white noise portion of that equation the reason its so reliable is that patterns signals shortterm behaviors and events will come and go somewhat arbitrarily which means quants have to live in a framework filled with crossvalidations and backtesting while the fundamental principles of running a business rarely change that quickly fundamental analysis is anchored in how businesses run in terms of real life cash flows not some complex and fragile mathematical abstraction that can either make you rich or ruin you at fiberoptic speed real life is messier than a lot of models will allow for the only reason its hard to be a valuebased investor is that sometimes your thesis doesnt materialize in the short to mediumterm people are extremely shortsighted by nature theyre impatient fickle and unapologetic for being so but in the longterm economic rationality and logic wins  of the time

in terms of indexing vs active security selection there is absolutely alpha to be generated however that alpha isnt easy which is what discourages a lot of people but the return on invested time if you will can be much greater and much more persistent than what simple indexing can provide if i told you that the sp had a cagr of  while venture capital had a cagr of  would you be interested a lot of people are and it just takes sound financial decisionmaking and calculated risktaking to do so

dont get me wrong im all about geeking out over aic and optimization but you have to at least understand the boundaries of the realm in which youre operating for it to be sustainable","i find my allocation of least regret is at least  of my capital in a stock market index with the remainder in speculative unprofitable microcaps on the verge of self funding which requires a fair amount of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) this allows me to stay invested at all times and hopefully enjoy outsized returns on the typically illiquid and unknown microcaps

so yeah i definitely treat it as a hobby","as far as i know there have been lots of studies and it essentially comes down this

the average performance of stock returns based on security analysis including all types of funds is about  below the market return you then also have to consider the higher level of transaction fees you will be paying which will correspond to another approximately  the same findings apply when studies look at only large very professionally managed funds so unfortunately you are off to a bad start and it gets worse 

on average the higher the number of transactions per year investors in equities perform the lower the returns this means the more short term orientated investors are the lower the return and funnily enough the delta here to sound like the guy who posted before is about the the additional fees incurred by more frequent trading 

now boys from underprivileged families with rags to riches fantasies of becoming a stock trader because they forgot their lunch money on kitchen counter one day and  read buffets books  times will say this thats only because there are many people who dont know what they are doing like i said the same or even worse if I recall correctly applies for professional funds if you think for some reason you are special and that you can do it irrespectively just know that youre expected return is about market performance so generally its a bad investment even if somehow you manage to double you money in a day and you think you have defied the statistics already remember it only takes one trade to lose all your gains if you make  on day and lose  then next you have nothing 

if you think what i am writing is nonsense because there are investors such as buffet out there who have consistently defied the market consider this buffets first big break was when he purchased insurance businesses and started investing the huge positive working capital they had lying around which goes a lot further than reading some annual reports and news articles not to mention in recent years hes focusing on creating synergies and professionalizing firms once they are part of his conglomerate and last but not least you have to realize that buffets returns since the start of his career to the present day have been about  standard deviations from the markets returns what that mean is that if buffet had only ever chosen stocks by pulling them out of a hat with all the sp company names written on pieces of paper in it he would have around a  in  million chance of achieving the returns he has done there many millions of investors and he is the most successful one so luck has likely played a role in his career not to mention eventually the buffet effect became significant as well

so as you alluded to in you question i think it is more of a hobby than a job the way finance creates value is by allocating capital to people who can best use it and whatever you are doing as a day trader or whatever it is not that the only way to beat the market is to have information or insight others dont and then they have to be accurate so if you are a car engineer perhaps you could choose the best car stock thats the idea but i wouldnt count on it sorry to be that guy but i hope i can save you some time and money i encourage you to do your own research given that the nature of finance is about assessing risk and probabilities of returns i am surprised by how many people are blind to these facts in a bear market things may be different than i described although i know of no evidence that suggests so oh and dont get me started on technicals ps excuse my writing i was in a hurry"

 mechanics

the strategy is pretty brain dead simple at the end of every year take an index the sp  in this example filter out a basket of high quality stocks equal weight those stocks and hold for one year rinse and repeat every year the filter is an equity screen i made that i believe crystalizes a group of companies with bestinclass management economic moat and financial stability while also trading at an attractive valuation this is not a predictive model i cannot tell you which of these stocks will shine nor by how much but i can say that the underlying qualities these stocks were selected for will perform strongly the final list of stocks is equal weighted to gain equal exposure to these qualities

note your backtest starts at the height of the dot com bubble and from the looks of it the majority of your outperformance comes from the  time period as well which makes sense because your portfolio has a valuation bias and likely didnt select tech stocks during the period i would doubt you have captured much outperformance post that period","as someone who wrote fundamentally based quant models for several years my impression is this it is very easy to create backtests that perform this well or better i wrote several while completely wasted in college that had yr returns that looked pretty repeatable over a similar period even when sober

in realtime testing they had alphas much closer to  and between taxesturnover the cost of the data and time spent it was worth it to just buy index funds if i wanted to get back into this world id probably buy moat or another qualitybased etf

several things to remember about quant models

 diversification has a relatively low value beyond  positions or so
 with anything but microcaps you are far from the only person trying to find quant factors
 for most portfolios backtesting looks way better than forward testing if you dont believe me look at the community portfolios over at portfolio some of these people are novices some know a fair amount a large number of them fail to beat the market over reasonable timeframes remember that youre looking at a heavy selectionbias sample even with those views also its worth reading what ben graham has to say on the subject i think hes generally right
 you need to factor the cost of the datatools taxes and transaction fees into your returns

Options trading,SecurityAnalysis,SoftBank unmasked as ‘Nasdaq whale’ that stoked tech rally,"softbank is the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) whale that has bought billions of dollars worth of us equity derivatives in a series of trades that stoked the fevered rally in big tech stocks before a sharp pullback on thursday and friday according to people familiar with the matter   
  
the japanese conglomerate had been snapping up options in tech stocks during the past month in huge amounts fuelling the largest ever trading volumes in contracts linked to individual companies these people said one banker described it as a dangerous bet  
  
  
  
the size and aggressiveness of the mysterious call buyer coupled with the summer trading lull has been a big factor in the buoyant performance of many big tech names as well as the broader us stock market according to mr mcelligott this week he warned that dynamics around options meant the heavy purchases forced banks on the other side of the trades to hedge themselves by buying stocks in a classic tail wags the dog feedback loop 

what could go wrong",257,"barrons previously reported that softbank had started making big bets on tech stocks including amazon alphabet and adobe Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE) during the june quarter

whether it was all softbank or not is moot bullish calloption buying has exploded over the past month traders have bought almost  times the number of call options expiring in november of those faang stocks plus microsoft and tesla than the equivalent number of put options




when calloption buying spikes it drives call sellers to buy underlying stock sending shares higher when brokers sell options contracts they dont want to take the risk of what happens to the underlying stock brokers only want to earn a commission sellingand tradingthe options often times brokers buy underlying stock to hedge their book of business that way any gains or losses on options positions are offset by corresponding gains in the underlying stock prices

so any explosion in calloption buying generates stock buying on the street thats one way to explain the  rise of those tech stocks since july

its also a way to explain the recent two day collapse calloption trading volume thursday in those tech stocks was down by roughly twothirds compared with recent highs",i cant recall which fund manager mentioned this but he said his firm wasnt in the business of trying to move markets because you can get trapped with dangerous positions i think stuff like this is what he was talking about if the market falls out now who knows whatll happen to them,strange times there are so many oddities right now

Options trading,SecurityAnalysis,Hedging Strategies,"have any fundamental analysts here been effective at putting on hedges over time not interested in day trading perspectives

my questions for you include

 do you stick to equity markets such as put options on overvalued securities

 if equity how do you determine the expiration date and strike prices do you just use short term options a few months out or do you buy longer dated options for  years away if longer term do you have to stick to the indices there doesnt seem to be much volume for individual names where you might want to bet on a  decline but have to use  because you dont know when the tide will go out

 how do you think about hedges do you allocate a portion maybe   percent as an annual cost or do you just hedge when you have specific concerns in varying portfolio allocations

 have you ever taken hedges in currencies or interest rates if so what was the learning process like in terms of understanding the mechanics and putting on the correct bet im a fundamental analyst and might have a view on some of these or at least want to take on tail risk hedges but have no experience executing trades like this can you take on trades that react to a specific interest rate instead of trying to calculate bond values at a particular date the further i move away from my circle of competence the less ill understand

edit to be clear im looking less for general guidance and more for the technical aspects im versed on the basics cfa charter work experience etc and am not dealing with existential questions of whether one should hedge or not",15,"you can also just hedge by picking stocks with good riskreward fundamentals a lot of people forget that 

owning a portfolio with  such stocks can give you a better risk profile at lower cost than any hedging instrument then if the return is still not up to your liking you can lever up to your ideal riskreward level

intelligent investing involves natural hedges utilizing hedging instruments isnt really necessary","not a big expert but some things worked better for me than others


if you look to hedge tail risk then probably you should look at units very far otm puts  because you are buying far otm you only have big indexes as real alternative cause once liquidity dries up you will not get a good price to hedge

such a hedge will normally kick in when you have a serious rug pull and can do wonders for your sharpe ratio and is relatively cheap you can throw probably like  of principal into it but will only matter if you have  drop or something

however volatility now us still pretty high all over the board and hedging now for a deflationary event like buying puts on spxspy is very expensive  generally with vix above  is expensive to hedge 

to choose a strike i normally go to something like  delta or even lower and buy a few of them as for time  that will depend on what is your scenario that you want to hedge for  like for example  will the stimulus get delayed and they will start doing shit politics  then probably that will unravel in the next few months and the i will pick  months out  so lets say my event will be feb then i will be looking at may june

you can hedge also with vix calls yet again now everything is expensive you will want to buy also far otm calls around  for vix

these ones dont decay like normal options and they are european cant be exercised early so you can buy closer to your event date

another hedge will be to buy calls on Streettracks Gold Trust (GLD) or gc but this is kinda different than above because if you have a selloff gold will fall along with everything however you are betting here that if things get nasty  then fedtreasurypoliticians will throw the towel and  print and when this happens normally gold rebounds fast  here you can get closer to at the moment and buy leaps  years the advantage here is that in current environment Streettracks Gold Trust (GLD) tends to drift higher anyway as long interest rates are around zero  so you can actually make money from you hedge of course once the economy will rebound and fed will stop qerise rates  then your position in gold derivatives will evaporate","it would depend on the goal and type of fundamental analysis as a disclaimer take this with a grain of salt because im some random guy on reddit 

tddr my response sort of answers  and  


if youre doing anything value related there is no need to hedge if youre sure that a stock is undervalued but may take years to realize then youre just holding on even if the share price dips for some arbitrary reason that doesnt change your thesis there wont be any material need to hedge you may say what about if youre wrong to which i would respond that if you have a doubt about the undervaluation of the company make sure to account for it in your valuation if there are any material changes to the company reevaluate and either hold or sell 

if on the other hand youre making a directional play or a more short term trade like within a year then hedging may have a role for example i just read that General Motors Corporation (GM) is backing out of their investment in nikola they wont be taking an equity stake or building the trucks perhaps if you bought into nikola under the thesis that they will be a leader in Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) semi trucks but were worried about the viability of the business mode or the shortreport you could have bought inthemoney puts at your cost basis say with an expiry within the year in theory your max loss from the hedge would be the price you paid for the puts while your max gain would be whatever the stock increases by minus the cost of your puts the hedge would essentially be a married put"
Options trading,SecurityAnalysis,Database Alternatives,"i am looking for alternatives to fullblown databases like capitaliq factset bloomberg or thomson

for statements the best option is to enter the data yourself from sec filings otherwise you can use sec live while you have to reformat the data they allow you to save data from financial statements directly into excel its really helpful",maybe thinknumcom you can scrape the models there but theres unfortunately no way to factcheck source and i think its getting dated
Options trading,SecurityAnalysis,Buying long term Puts on Marijuana stocks?,normally i dont do hedging or make short bets on anything and i focus on buying stocks at a discount to the pv of future cash flows however the weed stocks have my attention because of the ridiculous valuations cron trades at x sales and has not had a single cash flow positive or profitable quarter i dont like the idea of shorting because who knows how high it could go so i am interested in buying put options to put a floor on my downside risk specifically im looking at put options on cron that expire  with a strike around  anyone else looking to bet against the weed stocks if so how are you doing it and are there any other names that you believe are more overvalued than cron,22,you could try a deep in the money put for example the cron   put was traded for  yesterday max loss would be  but only if you held to expiration even if cron went up to  you likely wouldnt lose more than  if there was a year left until expiration if you wanted to do the   put it would be  you could even sell the  put against it for  raising your break even to  but would lower your max profit quite a bit,cron and tilray are right in the same ball park for overvalued acb and canopy are less so but still overvalued in my opinion,its like shorting tech in  you may be right but the timing might be off
Options trading,SecurityAnalysis,Long $VACQ (free optionality on Rocket Lab and Michael Burry!),"happy to share my long thesis on vacq free optionality on rocket lab and michael burry

im very open to discussion",39,why is it free optionality if the sponsor gets  after closing,just so you know the fact shares trade at or below Navistar International Corporation (NAV) before the redemption deadline is an indicator the market doesnt like the acquisition and shares will not trade well ex redemption date,"clarification of the general investment thesis  
  
you could see vacq as a  dollar investment in shortterm us government treasuries  a call option on postmerger vacq so effectively on the implied rocket lab valuation as vacq currently trades around  dollars you effectively get this call option for free it is not literally a call option but i find it a nice way to grasp the general investment thesis  
  
the free call option in that case has as underlying  postmerger share of vacq so the rocket lab valuation determines the value with a strike price of  and expiration date equal to the redemption deadline  
  
i like free call options especially when there are signals that they are valuable you could run a valuation yourself but im taking a shortcut here by just following michael burry in this case i also like that rocket lab is excitingsexyspeculativefuturisticglamorous as stock prices of such companies generally exhibit higher volatility which implies a higher value for its call options  
  
so a bit mindboggling but with vacq you are basically buying a financial security that has included a free call option on that same financial security  
  
just dont forget to sell before the redemption deadline because otherwise your full investment will be exposed to the rocket lab valuation"
Options trading,SecurityAnalysis,"Nomura Warns Of Imminent ""Gamma-Flip"" Risk In Stocks","nomuras charlie mcelligott explains below is simple  what forced selfreinforcing buying pressure on the way up is about to feed a vicious cycle of selling on the way down as stocks face an imminent gamma flip

and mceligott explains

the interpretation of trumps better to wait until after the election for a china trade deal comments is that the hong kong human rights bill sponsorship by potus has clearly caused agitated the chinese side plus this mornings reuters report stating that the white house is considering kicking huawei out of the us banking system and in conjunction with the narrowing window to act on the dec th tariff fill or kill is likely incentivizing monetization of of the  gain made in sp since early october via profittaking in recently options delta still th ile since  even after ydays selloff and futures asset manager sp futures notional position currently th ile since  at b positioning extremes

this extreme positioning into a dynamic where traders are incentivized to monetize into yearendespecially ahead of the dec th tariff riskhas been at the core of my view over the past few weeks that there was a local  tactical window for a pullback into late november start dec aint bad though

as such this riskoff dynamic is driving the bid in rates  usts reds and greens  to  ticks while weve seen real money and central bank buying flows in the frontendthus the bull steepening which too then will almost certainly result in a reversal later today of the us equities factor dynamic experienced on monday momentum down value up instead todays ust rally will then dictate a resumption of the momentum bounceback experienced over the past  weeks as longs in duration equities min vol defensives and secular growth are set to rally with cyclicals are likely to again fall

touching on my constant refrain over the past two yearsthat being where a macro shock then acts as catalyst for dealer gamma flip and  or in conjunction with a systematic trend deleveraging impulsewe see a mixedbag as our nomura qis cta model shows the majority of equities futures positions remain in trend and above estimated deleveraging  sell levels

what does it tell us

the gamma of an option measures the rate of change of the option delta its number is denoted relative to a one point move in the underlying asset for example if the gamma for an option shows  with a delta of  then a full point move in the stock ie  to  means the delta will move to 

gamma is calculated via an option model such as black and scholes or binomial the value is the same for both call and put options

the gamma of an option is important to know because the delta of an option is not constant the delta increases and decreases as the underlying moves because delta is essentially our position value in the underlying the gamma therefore tells traders how fast their position will increase or decrease in value vs movements in the underlying asset 

in other words gamma shows how volatile an option is relative to movements in the underlying asset so watching your gamma will let you know how large your delta position risk changes 

since the chart above shows us high gamma for strike prices between  and  it tells us that the sp can get very volatile around these trading ranges its like playing with dynamite throwing it back and forth until it explodes",63,where can you look at gamma flip for free at any given time,what are the implications of this as a value investor looking to invest in individual securities,oh wow im bachelors in economics and just what in the hell is that language i got that volatility is coming but else
Fundamental analysis,SecurityAnalysis,Auckland Airport Beginner Fundamental Analysis,"hey guys

im a new investor and decided to try somewhat of a fundamental analysis in accordance with a book i have been reading i decided to do it on auckland int airport  due to their strong competitive advantage monopoly and the hopeful improving travel conditions bw nz and aus any advicedirection on how to better the analysis would be greatly appreciated as most of the valuations are around half of the current share price

 margin of safety Mosaic Company (The) (MOS) was set at 

 yr Goodrich Corporation (The) (GR) was average eps growth rate over the past  years

the fundamentals of aia supported the books principles in that it has a good bv and profit growth over time as well has reduced its de to below 

however it lacks strength in roe advised was  avg and fcf advised was positive fcf over yr

thanks in advance",34,"basic questions

why would you use book value here

why would you think there would be profit growth here

why would you think there would be any current roe here

best way to look at a good government backed monoply is there is usually a regulatory amount the monopoly can charge to keep it in check  is there an austrailian transportation division that sets rates  who is ahead of the equity payouts what kind of debt owed to whom

how has austrailia handled airport bankruptcies in the pastdid they restructure the equity out",i imagine that the big challenge with this kind of projection in the current environment is that you have to make assumptions about covidinternational travel which are at best a bit of a guess with that said monopolistic assets like this are rarely a bad investment,"the fund i worked for looked at this briefly when they did their initial covid raise basically wasnt really in our mandate but also as  mentioned you have to make covid assumptions 

without giving you investment or business advice and going off your analysis only my feedback would be  


eps  fundamental issue with your pe analysis is that you have taken covid performance via your eps and applied a multiple to this the street are factoring in a return to normality in eps which in turn pushes up their willingness to pay vs your analysis  


pe  using any multiple you are making implicit assumptions about growth and discount rates and in the case of a pe assumptions around reinvestment rates i think using historical averages can be a good guide as to how the market sees these things in the past but i would look to construct this yourself on a go forward basis given there has been a significant change in these variables secondly my former point around eps has a signficant effect on the pe multiple you are using a normal state of the world multiple with covid earnings which is why your share price is so low   


Navistar International Corporation (NAV) analysis  i think although a good sense check the price this gives you is a bit academic in the context of a business like an airport i would use to check against your target price in order to generate a pb ratio i always like to sense check the pe i am using against pb and roe noting that pe  roe  pb breaking it down can always help you grasp the inputs in your analysis for the same reasons regularly check your roe outputs through dupont 

never used net  net so cant give any feedback 

for the growth model  covid eps issue from above  not quite sure what your assumptions are but again sense check them how realistic do you think they are a one stage model is incredibly inflexible the next simplest version is to have a  stage model and more complex version is creating a dcf this gives you the flexibility to change assumptions as the years go by   


other  


make sure you use fully diluted shares in your analysis 

not sure if your operating cf was from the cf statement or was constructed using fcff be careful as there are a few adjustments you need to make if you use the cf statement financing costs sbc

look to assess banking headway and covenants in your analysis as this will alert to chances of a dilutive equity raise chances of a reorg event in which the equity is in trouble of being wiped

Fundamental analysis,SecurityAnalysis,Fundamental analysis books + DCF modeling,"can anyone recommend me a practical fundamental analysis book that teaches actual methods for putting a quantitative valuation on a business 

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) read many books recently but they all seem tied to teaching about temperament and mindset



heres what iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) read recently

the intelligent investor  its one of the more quantitative books iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) read but the actual methods are outdated he mainly looks for good companies with strong balance sheets but i didnt see any part where hes putting target prices on the companies

the most important thing by howard marks

margin of safety by seth klarman

beating the street by peter lynch  mostly relative valuations and going to malls for research i would like to hear his thoughts on that now since the advent of econmerce

the little book that still beats the market by joel greenblatt  this one has some quantitative analysis in it but its really too simplified and his magic formula seems like a ploy so people buying into gothams portfolio if you check their f



iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been looking into aswath damadoran since he seems to be one of the few that talks about the actual valuation method dcf  do people recommend any specific books of his i watched his google talks and have been looking into the little book of valuation are there any others

also iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) heard that buffett says that you shouldnt be calculating it all down to  decimals he says he does it quickly in his head it makes sense since hes looking at s of companies and there should be a margin of safety

aswath seems to take it down to the deep end looking into waccs apvs and making large excel sheets 

i cant see buffett making excel models for all of the companies hes sifting through since he doesnt even use a computer do you guess that he filters companies out with relative analysis then does a rough mental dcf model in his head from all his experience 

anyways thanks in advance im attempting to read a lot but im having some trouble consolidating everything into an actual practical method i dont mind number crunching a spreadsheet but it seems unreasonable to do it for every k youre reading i guess i answered my own question

does anyone have a mental shorthand on how to gauge a rough valuation in their head based on cash flows might as well ask since were on the topic",35,"mckinseys valuation book is great

damodaran is wonderful",buffett knows what growth rates are tied to what valuations go run a dcf and youll find that there are pes for every growth rate and then you take all the other qualitativequantitative variables into play when deciding investment merit,it might not quite be what you are looking for but financial modeling by simon benninga is an amazing book that i think you would benefit from
Fundamental analysis,SecurityAnalysis,Fundamental analysis,hi have been trying to incorporate fundamental analysis more and more into my homework before buying a stock its a lot easier with american stocks as a lot of the calculations are done so for those i am just wondering how you guys rank the importance of different valuation calculations like pb vs growth of sales vs last year etc my other question is one company i think has a good future has negative equity currently and just because i want to invest in it doesnt mean i want to stupidly over pay for it but i am confused on to how decide on what the company is worth and what price i should look for it to hit before i can intelligently invest while it has a negative equity  this is my first time posting in this subreddit so hopefully i dont sound like an idiot thanks guys,16,"as a cfa charterholder and a person who has worked at  hedge funds the answer is

 it depends  each situation is different each industry is different  you cant just look at pb or pe and use  singular approach  pb means a lot in the banking industry  it means absolutely nothing when you are looking at a company like google
 the only way to really understand what a company is worth is to literally dedicate years of your life to understanding a finance b accounting c statisticseconomics  without a serious understanding of all  of those areas you are just scratching the surface

that doesnt mean you cant make money like pabrai and some other guys do with very basic rule of thumb investing pb etc  but i think they lack the world class sophistication and knowledge of what an economic entity company natural resource etc is worth without that knowledge base","you can use these multiples and standard ratios that morningstar and yahoo finance are regurgitating but please do try to open the latest quarterly report and run the equations yourself you will be surprised how often your favorite resources are  to  quarters behind in reporting

also review how to run a discounted future cash flows analysis as well as considering a margin of safety","i am confused on to how decide on what the company is worth

mulitples and dcf are your tools my friend for financial companies id look for pb as most important for marketing company ps is important its all done in context if there was a general approach then everyone would do it"
Fundamental analysis,SecurityAnalysis,Is there any serious analysis for finding the fundamental value of cryptocurrencies?,"i mostly invest in traditional stocks and bonds  i have been for  years  more recently iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been investing in preipo startups

in all of these cases iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been able to assign a value of what i think a particular security is worth or could be worth using traditional means  estimate future cash flows discount to present value etc

i had the opportunity to buy a particular cryptocurrency before it started trading on the open market  kind of a preipo cryptocurrency  i am wondering what it will be worth once it starts trading  my best guess encompasses a range from  to   i bought it for   it should start trading next week

the security analysis process that people seem to follow  is to rank all the different cryptocurrencies based on how useful they are or something like that  then compare it to the market cap of a similar ranking cryptocurrency

they define the market cap as the total number of cryptocurrency coins available times the price per coin for instance right now the  ranked coin is something called kusama ksm and it has a market cap of  billion  

one problem with this analysis is that some of these coins have built in dilution  they may have  million available right now but in  years it will be  million  i dont think people take this into account


how do you determine what these should be worth  it seems like this is a wide open problem and solving it could lead to great wealth",52,crypto does not have fundamental value at best they have a relative value,"there exists fundamental analysis of different protocols and their respective coins from analysts who apply value investing concepts to crypto but its use is creative at best and speculative at worst note that i dont think being creative is a bad thing its just a reflection of the fact that the application of valuation concepts to crypto shines a light on the limits of valuation concepts themselves

some bridges for people who view themselves as fundamental analysts who are seriously looking at crypto are from analystspms who have had both hats equities  crypto on themselves  here are my recommendations  


 from an mapleleadcapitalfoliusventures exfundamental hf guy now running crypto venture mlc web defi primer  probably the most cogent for analysts used to deep fundamental research 

 from chris burniske exark analyst   his book cryptoassets the innovative investors guide to bitcoin and beyond if you already know blockchain  crypto basics you can skip to the middle to look at the application of valuation concepts that are discussed in the podcast

 from justin drake researcher at the ethereum foundation   i skipped to the relevant part of the interview while justin isnt trained as a fundamental analyst him being a researcher for the ethereum foundation gives some color as to how people with a cryptoeconomics  mechanism design hat think about valuation hint these types use google docs to build dcfs but they also know how to write parallelizable python code to execute billion dollar defi flash loans

the best argument for fundamental value exrelative that iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) seen is in deflationary coins that produce dividendlike flows which can be converted into cash as in the case of posteip  ethereum which iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) roughly modeled out a couple months back using a dcf template w stock buyback component frankly building a fundamental model out of Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. (ETH) was probably more fundamental in nature than valuation of most saas privates and even publics in the current market certain protocols that technically arent crypto but utilize decentralized economic mechanisms in order to allocate compute and storage can arguably also be analyzed on a similar basis to the way awsazuregcp business segments are im thinking filecoin arweave etc in which you could comp s storage rates to filecoin storage rates  then extrapolate fees margin compresson market sizetam evolution of value capture etc

in general  has a lot of good material for formulating how one could fundamentally value different lessknown coins but i treat the content as priming material and not like a more rigorous sellside research report

my live reading list is here for reference 

edit for all of the dismissive low effort and uninformed takes crypto   in this thread you should remember that the market doesnt care if you sound smart you might feel smart but i place you guys in the same bucket as i place the shitcoin to  guys  both cohorts havent done any real research thinking that crypto is a monolith is like treating rsecurityanalysis like that Gamestop Corporation (GME) stonk subreddit  in the same way many of you dont know what Gamestop Corporation (GME) nonsense is being pumped today i have no idea what shitcoins are being pumped because i dont care theres a level of depth to this space that is completely invisible to people who are too lazy to look into aka sources of alpha for people who actually do the work and thats music to my ears personally",this is kind of like valuing any currency the currency has no value but the social and economic environments surrounding them do so just like with traditional currencies some will have stronger supporting factors than others
Fundamental analysis,SecurityAnalysis,Tools for Fundamental Analysis?,"hi so i have gotten into building financial models for companies and am running into problems when making revenue projections

im really hoping the answer isnt just get a bloomberg i want to do as much as i can free or low cost and frankly tos isnt cutting it

thanks for your help",6,i dont think there are really any easy answers for this one this is where the research part comes into play,"i have been using wwwibisworldcom for industry research while they have a wide coverage and is decently up to date it cost money i have free access through our school library p

for other alternatives that doesnt cost money id recommend to check industry organizations like american petroleum institute they publish annual guidanceforecast report and white papers","i think for market share maybe you can pool together the revenues of all the players in the industry then over a threeactually depends on nature of industry yearish rolling average you can normalize the revenue stream to account for seasonality and like heavily promotional years I don't know take a percentage of it and i suppose you have a crude estimate of market share 

and for market size the only thing id know how to do is just google and hope for the best to get an estimation but valuing the industry is very much like valuing the company i suppose all the discounted npv of future profits"

 different companies have different operation targeted market or team structures

Fundamental analysis,SecurityAnalysis,Fundamental security analysis - isn't this completely... wrong?,"first off im a complete noob when it comes to doing security analysis i watched martin shkrellis mooc on doing financial modeling hey gotta start somewhere right

one thing i noticed is that when projections are made people assume a lot of things like x revenue growth fixed or close to fixed margins etc etc better yet  their discount rate then they do their npv or whatever they come up with to determine the true value for them 

fine and dandy except theyre making directional stock bet on bunch of assumptions about the future from past ok i am saying the obvious

but wouldnt it be smarter create several scenarios and permutations of them to see where the most likely max and min based on the different parameters instead of using only  set of  parameter that you just kinda guess from looking at the past

im a data scientist so im talking about cluster analysis on returns generated from permutation of hyper parameters

or is this a complete waste of time",0,"people do do scenario analysis

whats the issue",i doubt theres an issue with modeling different scenarios id bet that most security analysts tend to just use conservative numbers and invest in companies where theyre more confident that these conservative estimates will play out stable industry good knowledge etc  rather than throwing a bunch of models together to get an average,"the purpose of financial modeling is to determine the value of security under possible future states or scenarios 

most analysts model three scenarios bull base and bear with sufficient variation in assumptions but holding the discount rate constant if there are specific issues you want to test then you test them separately eg what happens to operating income  and the stock price  if organic sales declines given the companys embedded operating leverage

your multiple permutations model sounds like a monte carlo model these can be useful if you build them carefully ie know how to specify the randomness and correlations of input variables"
Technical analysis,SecurityAnalysis,What is your favorite type of short thesis?,"in my humble opinion iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been using accountingrelated indicators of earnings management or fraud when i select companies to short 

but iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) also selected shorts based on melting ice theses in the past such as coinstar or the mattress industry doesnt always work due to buyout risk im sure weve already heard the saying never short on valuation which iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) learned first hand to follow

any other favorite reasons to short no technical analysis how has those strategies worked for you overall",26,my honest answer is that short selling is so hard the best shorts are one where you have multiple angles in the short thesis accounting insider selling increasing competition bad capital allocation lazy consensus estimates and valuation,"iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) also selected shorts based on melting ice theses in the past  

in my experience this is one of the worst type of shorts because the melting part of it can take forever with shorts the quicker they work out and less exposed you are to your cost of carry  the market ripping your face off the better 

a critical component to shorting that most miss and one that i learned the hard way is the why now an industry can be in secular decline a company can have accounting problems it can have too high a valuation whatever but why is this moment the time to put a short on getting the timing right is the hardest part 

for example i knew elli was a short this summer but never pulled the trigger Brunswick Corporation (BC) there just wasnt a catalyst i could see no catalyst plus they had balance sheet optionality to lever up and buy more stuff to jump start their slowing topline just made it too risky to put on 

but anyway my favorite type of shorts are the asymmetric type where if im wrong i really dont lose much money i love shorting bonds atnear par Brunswick Corporation (BC) if im wrong im only out my carry equity shorts have to be a pretty special situation with regard to the catalyst time line just because your downside is unlimited in theory","i have yet to bother with shorts if one was good it would have three things if someone could do all this i dont know why they would publish it however

 obviously a compelling argument

 why now we would have been wrong according to the market as it kept rising this long what has changed or what could cause the market to not remain so irrational shorting stupidity is stupid because if stupid activity is what caused it to bid up then bad decisions are all it takes for it to continue to rise

 what are the hedging costs i dont want a naked short how do i protect myself buy call options every month what kind of expenses do i pay to borrow the stock for the short"

engineering is a major italian information technology group which provides services such as software solutions it infrastructure and business expertise on a global level although  of its revenues are still derived in italy the group is organized around four main market divisions pa government and healthcare  utilities and telco  industries  services  and finance  the company has a market cap of m euros employs over  employees and achieved revenues of m in  yoy growth a  ebit margin
 
 
eng has  main revenue streams system integration  consulting outsourcing and proprietary licences and fees

system integration  consulting

characterised by contracts lasting less than one year focus on providing it services on enterprise content management content workflow and knowledge management they also consult in areas such as organisation governance and people management these areas of revenue offer higher profitability compared to outsourcing contracts due to the higher value of service provided and the nature of the price structure turnkey contracts

outsourcing application management and cloud services		
managed operations department provides clients with a full offering of outsourcing services thanks to a highly technological centre located in pont saint martin it infrastructure is also based on torino padua milan vicenza and rome sites despite lower profitability in this area outsourcing guarantees more visibility thanks to longer contracts  years and c of contract value is made of a fixed amount outsourcing is anticyclical in economic downturns and firms need to further improve their cost structure they prefer to outsource it services or computerize manual processes 

proprietary licences and fees 

eng can rely on more than  proprietary solutions spanning from a Salesforce.com Inc (CRM) suite for utilities to compliance and governance software for banks the offer of proprietary software is characterized by high profitability and strong customer retention high barrier to entry depending on whether the software is recognised as market leader

eng is a services company  of its costs are made up of personnel costs and the cost paid to rd party suppliers due to the heavy variable cost structure the ability to improve margins is mostly derived through increasing labour productivity and efficiency as well as reducing prices paid to suppliers the business is also slightly seasonal the first half of the year consists of around  of revenues typically increasesdecreases in spending see a delay of  months to gdp changes due to the nature and length of an it project

the opportunity

negative market sentiment in europe seems to have influenced engs price  since its peak in april  the stock has dropped by  to  trading at x  pe yet the company fundamentals have stayed consistent over this period q results were weak ebit down  yoy to m and the price drop might have reflected this however these results were in line with management expectations taking into consideration the integration process of the company engineeringmo ex tsystems italia and the consolidation of the newlyacquired company mht we can safely say there were no fundamental issues in the meantime we have seen a recovery of margins top line growth and a positive net financial position results in h are reflective of a solid business with potential to benefit from international expansion or a share buyback with the cash that has been generated top line growth was  yoy ebit grew  to m and ebit margins also improved by bps to  improvements in public administration payment times led to an increase in the net financial position by  to m
engineering stock is artificially depressed on top of the overbearing market forces we are expecting bestinver to sell its  stake in engineering after the departure of francisco garcia parames as fund manager bestinver is facing billion euros in redutions to its aum and will most likely begin to sell off its positions to liquidate market reaction to this news has led to further derating of the stock as people anticipate the selloff  

margins are they sustainable

given its capital returns  operating history  cagr  and international growth prospects engineerings current valuation is only justifiable if  margins begin to fall off or  large amounts of receivables are written off in the first case we would be looking at future increases in costs andor severe deflation in the prices clients pay for the services eng provides this would also suggest eng loses pricing power in its market second engineering holds a large amount of receivables on its books m as of h  the risk here is that clients default on the debt owed and engineering is forced to write off large proportions of its balance sheet in this section we will explain why these  main risks are not significant enough to make up for the recent movements in the stock price 


trade receivables risk

at face value the trade receivables situation that engineering is facing does not look good i would definitely consider this the biggest risk the company faces in the next  years the group claims that the type of operations justifies the high amount of receivables such as the proportion due from the public administration contractual durations trade receivables are all due within  months however the biggest issue here is the amount of receivables that are overdue these have increased by  to m moreover almost  of receivables are overdue by  days meaning the debtor hasnt paid in  months yet most of the increase in overdue receivables has come from doing business with the italian government the group has indicated that government bodies often do not respect the conditions established by contracts but this does not result in irrecoverable receivables in other words even though the government is extremely slow at paying engineering they do not expect the debt to be defaulted
the problem of overdue receivables is reflected in the dispute with the region of sicily over almost m which has been ongoing for over  years  after speaking to management about the problem they have emphasised that they are confident they will be paid their auditors are not in the condition to ask engineering to write off the credit implying a high grade of confidence in getting payment back another notable positive there are expected future improvements to payments terms from public administration due to the european late payment directive imposing members of the eu to pay their private suppliers within  days these changes would lead to further cash flow improvements

benefits from a positive National Financial Partners Corporation (NFP)

since eng is cash positive m  yoy increase the options for share buy backs increase in dividends and also growth through international acquisitions are all likely in  we are expecting a  cents dividend payout which has increased from  cents in  in addition management has clearly mentioned that we are plainly aware of the underevaluation of our company meaning we can invest some of our cash in buying back shares the half year report has confirmed that the shareholders have voted in favour of a share repurchase plan for a maximum of m shares within a maximum time frame of  months  engineering has m outstanding shares so the share buyback policy could lead to  of shares being repurchased this is a highly significant figure and it is great news to know the company is this confident that the shares are undervalued once the company begins to repurchase shares this should further restore market confidence the belief that the stock is undervalued is certainly prevalent within the company chairman michele cinaglia has recently engaged in buying over  of shares over the months of august and september using his personal wealth 
management says they are evaluating investments abroad which so far have proved to be the strongest sources of growth and are convinced that geographical expansion will be one of the key points of success",6,"that is a solid first draft you probably are  of the way there here are the issues on a macro level

 you need to get a breakdown of revenue and profitability by business type how much of the business is outsourcing vs licensing vs it integration

 i think youre missing a section on margins you talk about it but there isnt much there how sustainable do you think they are

 those trade receivables are a concern youd need to get a better feel for which lines of business and what sectors they are against assuming it is against revenue sectors big assumption then the eu directive only helps with  of it 

 youre missing a discussion on debt what is their interest coverage is their debt floating or fixed how is their liquidity

 given their debt profile how do they expect to implement their buyback  buyback of a m company  m with only m in the bank rerun your numbers on their debt profile post such a buy back 

 what is their capexsales ratio how does this compare against their competitors probably should be linked to the debt discussion what does this say about their growth profile

 some of the statements you make are contradictory 

however after  years of market decline assinform forecasts an increase in overall spending by  in 

so really spend has stabilized also how big has the decline in spend over the last seven years also

 business expertise on a global level although  of its revenues are still derived in italy

so really theyre italian focused with some experience elsewhere",nan,nan

if such a scenario came to be at current gross margins bo would need to raise more equity before the end of the fiscal year as of may  net working capital was only  million and they recently raised another  million so if gross margins are held constant growth is  and sga are held constant i calculated that they would end the year with only  million in cash and thus need to raise more they can cut marketing spend and continue to deplete inventories but i dont think thats a successful longterm strategy

Technical analysis,SecurityAnalysis,Deciding on the next book to read,"finished the intelligent investor recently and now debating on whether to start security analysis by graham or margin of safety by klarman or any other suggestions if you have any

i felt like the intelligent investor only had a few key takeaways and couldve been more efficient in getting to the point i also felt like an issue was that a lot of the technical concepts of the intelligent investors are pretty outdated ie using earnings instead of fcf and would like my next read to be more useful in screening stocks to elaborate i would like a book that would give me tools on how to assess a company with measurements and thresholds",7,"the most important thing

it goes over the same concepts of the intelligent investor just over a broader scope and much better articulated you can get it with annotations from legends like klarman and greenblatt and foreword by buffett so you know its not any random book","security analysis is probably your best bet if you want to learn some new tricks and techniques for analysing companies because margin of safety is more of a discussion of what investing is and what klarmans philosophy is  its less of a practical guide and more of a discursive essay on investing as an art

however if you thought the intelligent investor could have been more efficient youll probably feel the same about security analysis its quite a hefty tome",definitely margin of safety awesome book it is basically a more modern version of the other two that more efficiently gets to the point only thing i didnt really like is a big chunk is dedicated to junk bonds and i dont really care about bonds

yes  too telegraphed and locked in not to but next year is more of a crap shoot given recent fomc quasidovishness

is housing data an important leading indicator

yes especially orders but it is still unclear whether the current order slowdown is due to a rate bump or other factors  formations and overall starts still way below long term trends  a bump in the cancellation rate along with an order slowdown will signal bad things  i dont think that will happen though

ge as theyre just such a big debt issuer and well get an update on the long term care debacle   it is still incredible to me that the kansas dept of insurance waived statutory accounting rules so ge could stairstep its b reserve bump  why would a known major financial liability not appear on a balance sheet  another thing nobody talks aboutthe big pension hole they have  billion  where the heck is that money going to come from as they have boomers retiring and being laid off

Market trends,SecurityAnalysis,"The markets this week were hit hard with headlines on the tariffs/trade war, and perhaps interest rate trends. Banks were among the hardest hit. Thoughts on why?","it is clear that tariffs can directly impact the microeconomics of many industrials or consumer products companies however the selloff seemed to be broader and more dramatic to be attributed to trade issues alone from my perspective 



a few noteworthy things that happened this week

the fed increased the fed funds rate another  BP p.l.c. (BP)

the long term yields sharply peaked on wednesday yet fell andor stabilized thursfri

bac J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) Wells Fargo Cap Orix Corp Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS) (IX) (WFC) Bank of New York Company, Inc. (The) (BK) were each down  this week and were hit hard on friday

dow and sp were down around 

Bank of New York Company, Inc. (The) (BK) which has had very little press coverage was sold off particularly hard on thursfri one of my bigger holdings and i thought the valuation was already modest




any thoughts on why the banks have been taking such a shellacking when they are probably the least impacted by trade treaties and while interest rates have unsurprisingly continued their upward trend



is it the manifestation of larger macroeconomic factors and uncertainties eg gdp growth if so i cant seem to tell what those would be

edit formatting",11,"one of the notable issues not listed from this week was the techlash in the wake of the facebookcambridge analytica scandal there are real fears that business models that rely primarily on monetizing user data see google facebook may take a hit due to increased regulatory scrutiny and the deletefacebook movement also european regulatory scrutiny of us tech champions is getting increasing news coverage  latest talks are that the eu is hoping to tax  of tech firms gross revenues claiming that companies like fb and Google Inc. (GOOG) have been too savvy at dodging local taxes while this mostly affects National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) i think that seeing any of the market champions like fbgoogamzn get hit hard also hurts confidence 

another thing potentially impacting markets is the new Trinity Industries, Inc. (TRN) spending bill signed this week in the us with the economy almost at full steam conventional theory goes that fiscal spending could lead to economy overheating which may force feds hand to raise rates faster than anticipated it also probably doesnt help that the bill was signed very hastily narrowly averting a government shutdown which some think highlights a growing governance crisis in the us 

but really its the fears of trade war that matter china took a hardline stance that they will respond swiftly and decisively to tariffs and their threat needs to be credible  no chance they will let us bully them a trade war is bad for stocks period very bad",something is happening on liborois,a decent  amount can be explained also just by looking at the historical betas of these companies all of which vary between x multiply that by the market movement and you get close to your  number banks are both cyclically and financially leveraged companies by their nature
Market trends,SecurityAnalysis,Investment opportunities in tech companies who adopt this go-to-market strategy,"hi

i work as a pm at a large tech company and as part of my job its important for me to understand major technology trends i put this post together to outline a major technology trend bottomsup sales and to analyse some potential investment opportunities to go along with this trend

 bottomup software sales

the bottom up gotomarket strategy is the main sales strategy used by some of the worlds fastest growing enterprise software companies from atlassian to zoom

the premise behind the bottomup strategy is simple instead of taking a topdown approach where software is sold directly to company leaders CNOOC Limited (CEO) cto etc bottomup software can be adopted by individuals or small teams at a company before expanding to being used companywide

for example zoom is often initially adopted by individual salespeople to run a remote sales call before being eventually adopted companywide to run all company meetings

there are huge opportunities for public investors who can understand and identify companies that are successfully using the bottomup strategy in this post ill explain the benefits of a bottomup strategy and list some exciting public companies using this strategy to their advantage

 whats so special about bottomup

there are a number of distinct advantages to the bottomup strategy that makes for incredible businesses and investments

xb

 lower cost of customer acquisition cac traditional topdown software companies such as oracle and sap spend a massive amount of money on sales they need to since they are selling to clevel executives and their products typically cost millions to implement bottomup businesses dont have this problem users can sign up to their products directly from the website in minutes therefore they spend far less money on sales and can acquire customers for far less
 more money for rd since bottomup companies dont need to employ a large sales force they can spend more of their revenue on research and development they can either focus on improving their current product offering or building brand new products  
    this creates a really powerful flywheel effect less money spent on sales  more money for rd  a better and faster improving product  more customers  less money spent on sales
 more chances to be adopted topdown companies only really get one or two chances to sell to a customer if the CNOOC Limited (CEO) doesnt like your sales pitch theres not much you can do bottomup companies have hundreds of chances to be adopted since they can be adopted by individual employees or small teams
 you can sell downmarket many of the best saas software as a service products are used by both startups and large companies due to their bottomup strategy this allows them to access a larger total addressable market generate revenue early get quicker feedback and to also grow revenue naturally as their customers grow in size topdown companies typically dont sell downmarket due to the high sales costs involved for them

 what to look for in a bottomup company

not all bottomup companies are created equal here are some important things to look out for when evaluating investment opportunities

xb

 look for a receptive market the bottomup strategy is not a onesizefitsall approach the approach just doesnt make sense for some products and markets eg payroll software needs to be adopted companywide for it to be effective whereas project management software can be easily adopted by individuals or small teams this is a receptive market
 worldclass design bottomup companies can only be successful if their products can be easily adopted and used by individual users to provide value quickly these products need to be intuitive simple and a joy to use look for products that fit this description if you are unsure on how to evaluate design quality go to websites such as g and read customer reviews
 growing average revenue per customer bottomup products are easily adopted by individual employees however the real test of a bottomsup product is whether or not it spreads within each customer and starts to generate more and more revenue look for companies where this is happening if a bottomup company is only growing through new customer acquisition then this is a bad sign their product is not being widely adopted at each customer
 high sales efficiency ratio in the same vein as the advantage of having a low cac high quality bottomup companies should have high sales efficiency ratios as they need to employee fewer salespeople than topdown companies
 moving upmarket while the ability to sell downmarket is a big advantage you should be wary of companies that only sell downmarket look for companies that sell to both fortune  companies and startups

 bottomup companies

below are some bottomup companies that are in my opinion great investment opportunities please note that this is not investment advice and just the companies that im excited about for my personal portfolio

 asana asan

asana is a project management software company that ipod in late september it is the archetypical bottomup company individual usersteams adopt asana to run their own projects before it is eventually adopted companywide as the goto project management tool

i like asana for a couple of reasons

xb

 asanas sales efficiency is  this is a very healthy number for a newly public company and shows that their bottomup strategy is working very well
 rd spend is  of revenue while this may seem incredibly high to some and could be a negative sign at a more mature company as explained above bottomup companies live and die on the quality of their product a high  spend on rd shows that asanas management clearly understand where their money can create the most longterm shareholder value
 product  design quality this is an entirely personal opinion but iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) used asana extensively and its the bestdesigned project management tool iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) ever used
 yoy revenue growth of  even though asana is a relatively young company revenue growth of  is incredibly impressive

 slack work 

slack is a business chatcommunications tool for companies colleagues can send dms to each other create channels chat rooms private groups and more it is becoming the defacto internal communication channel for many of the worlds fastest growing companies

i like slack for a couple of reasons

xb

 product stickiness once slack is adopted companywide it is incredibly hard to replace the deep customisation allowed different channels private groups etc and the amount of stored knowledge in the system means that many companies would almost grind to a halt if they could not use it they would not be able to effectively communicate this is in contrast to a tool like zoom which could be fairly easily replaced if better video conferencing software was available
 average user activity is  minutes per day the average slack user spends  minutes every day on the platform this is an incredible example of the value that slack is providing to its users and is indicative of a bottomup product that is getting adopted companywide
  of the fortune  use slack as mentioned above a critical measure of a bottomup company is whether or not they can move upmarket slack is being used by some of the worlds fastest growing public companies it is also used by amazon which at the time of writing is the rd largest company by market cap in the world

 honourable mentions

below are some more bottomup companies that are definitely worth investigating

us housing confidence is neutral to negative both from the home builders side to the consumer side must be a factor of higher rates

Economic indicators,SecurityAnalysis,On the Origin of Systemic Risk,"credit to g



abstract 

systemic risk in the banking sector is usually associated with long periods of economic downturn and very large social costs on one hand shocks coming from correlated exposures towards the real economy may induce correlation in banks default probabilities thereby increasing the likelihood for systemictail events like the  great financial crisis on the other hand financial contagion also plays an important role in generating largescale market failures amplifying the initial shocks coming from the real economy to study the sources of these rare phenomena we propose a new definition of systemic risk ie the probability of a large number of banks going into distress simultaneously and thus we develop a multilayer microstructural model to study empirically the determinants of systemic risk the model is then calibrated on the most comprehensive granular dataset for the euro area banking sector capturing roughly  or eur  trillion of euro area banks total assets over the period  the output of the model decompose and quantify the sources of systemic risk showing that correlated economic shocks financial contagion mechanisms and their interaction are the main sources of systemic events the results obtained with the simulation engine resemble common marketbased systemic risk indicators and empirically corroborate findings from existing literature this framework gives regulators and central bankers a tool to study systemic risk and its developments pointing out that systemic events and banks idiosyncratic defaults have different drivers hence implying different policy responses",36,nan,nan,nan
Economic indicators,SecurityAnalysis,Impact of lower oil prices on the stock market?,"can someone please explain to me why the lower oil prices is causing a panic in the market i know that crude oil prices are seen as a leading indicator of the economic health but this crash in price is due to a supply side shock were prices trending downward prior to this due to virus factories closed and reduced air travel shouldnt the price decrease actually benefit consumers since they can spend the money and help improve sales 

what companies apart from energy firms will be most affected by this

too long; didn't read can someone please explain why low oil prices is causing a market panic thanks",42,this is a good question i dont know the exact answer but since it was so steep and unexpected this will cause companies to declare bankruptcy which will hurt lenders and investors theres a difference between lower oil prices such that oil companies stay in business lenders lend less and investors invest less such that overall oil companies earn less profit vs such low prices so fast where oil companies declare bankruptcy people lose their jobs financial service companies have tons of writeoffs with some boutique ones also declare bankruptcy etc this has much more significantly bad impacts in the shortterm and it takes more time before the benefits of lower oil prices are realized if this proves just a temporary measure which causes many us oil companies to go out of business then the saudis raise the price back up to barrel that overall would have a negative impact on the us economy not a positive one which could be priced in right now since that is many peoples expectations,"low oil prices benefit some industries eg those who use crude as a major raw material

on the flip side it also has negative implications for many others oil companies integratedupmiddownstream oilfield service companies eg schlumberger or any others in the value chain eg logistics us shale currently highly levered industrial companies who manufacture equipment or supply materials to build and operate oilfield operations staffing companies and financial companies as people get laid off this could have an unfavorable domino impact on consumer companies as well","debt crisis risk low oil prices always lead to waves of bankruptcies in the oil  gas sector

so far the one major silver lining in the whole coronavirus  stock market crash  global freakout has been that the banks have looked rock solid

related to banks but not oil one of the last halfmeaningful indicators left that isnt screaming this is  all over again is the ted spread you dont want to see anything that might fiddle with that switch even if youre not a big believer in the continuing value of the ted spread you dont want to see it jump

it has ticked up but only above its ludicrously low levels so far so good there

to be clear if the market dips below  were talking about a crisis as bad as the combined effects of com

after that your only remaining sane analog for a worsening situation is the  financial crisis that would send the market to  or  after that youre talking black monday beyond unlikely but that would send the market well below 

there just isnt a lot of room left for this thing to crash before the whole system goes dead however expect the market to fight brutally for every Suncor Energy (Inc.) of ground between  and  vix gonna be crazy

the only remaining question is is everyone just fleeing to cash looking at things like bitcoin it seems like the answer may be yes because there is some crazy stuff happening that goes beyond even what youd expect in a fullon panicmassacre

i think i mentioned on this sub last week that i think this is com bad not  bad i still stand by that if so you want to see the market put up a fight to stay above  if the close today is any indicator thats whats happening

whats happening right now though is everyone is sort of asking each other is this  bad in the absence of a good answer folks are trying to let someone else hold the bag"
Economic indicators,SecurityAnalysis,The Fall of the US Banking Sector,"over the last  years we have noticed interest rates have been much lower than the previous  years reaching new lows after each cycle accommodative monetary policies have become the standard tool to jumpstart economies after each downturn this is no different in  as we feel the effects of covid where long term interest rates have again fallen to the same levels as those experienced in the gfc low interest rates usually stimulate the financial equities markets by increasing spending and credit lowering the discount rate and making the higher returns provided by equities more attractive however do we see the same effects in the banking sector which has a unique and more direct relationship with interest rates

interest rates in japan and europe have been at or below zero for the last decade which has also coincided with significant downwards pressure in the stock price of each regions banking sector i want to investigate the validity of a causal effect in this relationship and how it may affect us banks in the next decade as the us heads back towards the zero lower bound and potential negative rate territory

banking sector performance in a low interest rate environment

following the global financial crisis all three bank indices in the us japan and euro area saw their prices drop more than  see fig  banks in japan and the euro area never saw their prices make meaningful recoveries since in the backdrop of zero to negative interest rates however banks in the us recovered to their  highs in the backdrop of increasing interest rates 




an argument could be made that this could simply be a reflection of the us stock market having had one of the best bull markets this last decade whilst both japan and euro stock markets have struggled the counter argument is that although the us bank index kbw has largely tracked the us market index spy both the japan and euro bank indices topix and sxe have decoupled from their respective market indices nikkei and euro stoxx  both the nikkei and euro stoxx  have largely recovered their losses from the gfc but again the banks in either region have not 



another argument one could make is that the difference in price growth could be due to a result of the proliferation of share buybacks that has occurred in the us stock market compared to that of japan and the euro area banks also usually yield high dividends which are not reflected in the chart in fig  i dont have the data to explore the impact of share buybacks and dividends further but i assume the significant divergence in the indices are little explained by share buybacks and dividends alone  

for the same trends we see in japan and europe to hold true in the us an assumption must be made that the federal reserve fed will hold interest rates near or potentially even below zero for a significant period i believe there is a high probability that this will be the case as we saw in  tightening monetary policy resulted in fear in the financial markets it will become ever more difficult for reserve banks to unwind reserve assets and pull back from accommodative policies as low interest rates become the framework on which the new economy is built on 

interest rate effects on bank profitability

first i want to examine the effect of reserve bank interest rate policies on bank profitability the impact that interest rate changes will have will depend on a range of variables such as the banks asset and debt portfolio the maturity gap between its assets and liabilities and noninterest portion of income such as fee income for products and services 

the effect of lower interest rates on profitability come directly from the level of rates and the yield curve the effect of the level of interest rates can be summarized as follows

 banks partially fund their operations with retail deposit at rates set as a markdown on market rates this markdown is compressed as interest rates decrease because the deposit rate cannot fall below zero therefore as interest rates decrease the net interest rate margin on banks also decreases 

 lower interest rates will generally induce more lending and investments in riskier assets in search for higher returns this is the whole point of accommodative monetary policy low interest rates and may increase net interest rate margins however this depends on economic conditions as a weak economic outlook precisely the reason why rates may be low can limit demand for loans 

the effect of the yield curve is explained by the operation of banks taking shortterm loans and granting longer term loans therefore net interest rate margins are compressed when the yield curve flattens and increased when the yield curve steepens

if we examine the net interest rate margin of banks in all three regions we see an overall downtrend inline with that of central bank interest rate policies see fig  the net interest rate margin is lowest japan for the region with the lowest average interest rate over the last  years and vice versa us the average net interest rate income growth follows the same trend where the growth is lowest japan for the region with the lowest average interest rate over the last  years and vice versa us 



in all three regions despite a low interest rate environment the average net interest income portion of total income remains steady except for the period following the gfc banks have seemingly not been able to supplement the loss in net interest margin with noninterest income through this period 

in conclusion there will likely be downwards pressure on the income and share price of bank stocks in the us in the next cycle i dont believe we will see the same catastrophic failure of the banking sector like we saw in the gfc banks are extremely well capitalized with healthy liquidity and stable funding rates following the gfc and resulting stringent regulations through basel iii liquidity issues have been further dampened by the fed initiating infinite qe and buying up seemingly every type of asset save for equities",89,"banks can supplement the loss of interest income domestically by expanding to em countries you see that with european and japanese banks 

what we will see in the us is further ma activity we have roughly  banks currently i expect roughly k left by the next decade credit unions dont pay taxes and will continue to gain market share

if you want a real short play on banks look at the big  in australia their nims are getting crushed and wont recover their regulators are also a lot more friendly towards fintech banks",there are plenty of cases studies with banks being profitable with negative interest rates in europe bnp cs santander UBS AGCO Corporation (AG) (UBS) intesa etc turns out banks just need to charge higher rates ie less negative than whatever the underlying interest rates are to be profitable,"why is berkshire long banks then
what if interest rates rise dramatically"
Economic indicators,SecurityAnalysis,Air Wisconsin (OTC: HRBR) – The Undiscovered Airline IPO,"summary

harbor diversified otc hrbr is one of the strongest riskreward opportunities on the market today harbor diversified is a nonoperating entity that owns air wisconsin  a us domestic regional airline that remains undiscovered and undervalued by the market a  upside to the current share price of  is easily achievable based on the companys existing economics being fully understood and realized by the market

mispricing

 this opportunity exists because of the dynamics surrounding how this security became publicly traded and the fact that it is an illiquid microcap security trading on otc markets
 air wisconsin airwis became harbor diversified Suncor Energy (Inc.)via a merger in  with harbor biosciences a cashburning pharma business with substantial nols and deferred tax assets for the profitable airwis to take advantage of
 hrbr went dark and ceased to publish filings with the sec leaving investors unaware of the merger nine years later an investor travis martin learned of this merger and filed a lawsuit demanding that hrbr release financials as they had  shareholders
 consequently hrbr released its  k in july  revealing an undiscovered airline ipo that lacked the fanfare and marketing of a traditional ipo process
 over the past few months we have learned about the company in bits and pieces via quarterly filings with the  k being released on april   given these facts airwis trades at x  ebitdar x  revenue x  earnings x yearend  book value and generates a  free cash flow yield

business

 hrbr is a holding company that now consists solely of airwis and the nols of the pharma business  million of Digitas, Inc. (DTAS) the remainder of the pharma business was liquidated
 it owns  crj aircrafts and flew four million passengers annually prepandemic
 the company operates under a capacity purchase agreement cpa with united airlines ual in which airwis serves as a united express regional carrier
 airwis operates routes to  cities across the us all of which depart from or arrive at two ual hubs chicago ohare and washington dulles
 market cap of  million and generated  million of revenue in  at a  ebit margin and a  ebitdar margin
  million of net cash and trades at x todays book value airwis generated  in fcf per share in 
 trades at x  ebitdar x  revenue x  earnings x yearend  book value and generates a  free cash flow yield

industry

 regional airlines provide aircraft fleet maintenance and crew the larger airlines pay for fuel and aircraft insurance sell tickets and plan routes a typical contract compensates the regional airline on the basis of operating statistics such as number of departures timeliness customer satisfaction and available seat miles asm
 regional airline industry relies primarily on leisure travel this industry will benefit immensely upon the economy reopening with pentup leisure travel demand serving as a tailwind for the latter half of  into early 
 air wisconsin strategically anticipated this by announcing  new routes departing from milwaukee to charleston south carolina myrtle beach south carolina pensacola florida portland maine and savannah georgia

airwis has strong unit economics because of the ual contract

 on an asm basis airwis earns  in ebitdar per asm compared with  for regional cpa peers skywest airlines and mesa airlines
 in october  airwiss contract with ual was renegotiated and incentivebased components were suspended tying the economics of the contract entirely to the operating statistics plus a fixed payment regardless of flight volumes
 the contract provides an extension until february  with two renewal options to  and to  precontract renewal airwis earned  per asm compared to  for peers it is clear that airwis had superior contract economics before the pandemic and obtained even better terms with ual during the pandemic
 airwis saw more favorable ebitdar margins with an astonishing  far outpacing mesas  and skywests 
 airwiss contract economics are stronger than peers because of the history between the two companies and the flight route economics airwis has been flying as a united express carrier since the early s and pioneered the concept of codesharing as a regional air carrier their relationship with united is far more entrenched than skywests who started serving ual in the early s and mesas who started serving ual in the late s
 furthermore airwiss flight routes out of iad operate at near monopoly status with greater passenger density given that united is the only airline with a hub at dulles comparatively mesa and skywest operate primarily out of more crowded hubs eg lax where ual dal and aal all share a hub airwiss routes out of iad have shorter distances comparatively yet still command price premiums given the monopolized status of these routes thus given the long and favorable history of service between ual and airwis and the fact that the routes airwis serves operate as monopolies with high passenger density airwis has been able to achieve superior contract economics than peers

government support has provided substantial cash

 airwis received a total of  million from the us government in  from the cares act psp and another  million from the Pogo Producing Company (PPP) loan
 this years strong earnings largely driven by government support and reduction of lease expense enabled airwis to increase its cash balance from  million to  million during  without raising any debt aside from the Pogo Producing Company (PPP) loan
 airwis will receive a further  million in  from the us government through psp and psp according to the us treasury with this government support airwis will earn x its market cap in net income this year
 airwis is extremely unlevered compared to peers sitting at a net debtebitdar of x compared to peers mesa and skywest with x and x respectively
 as of the announcement of psp and psp airwis has  million of net cash Suncor Energy (Inc.) leases this towering net cash balance will create the opportunity for airwis management to deliver cash back to shareholders via a special dividend or share repurchases

airwis will become profitable on a normalized basis due to lease purchases

 in  earnings will be stronger than in  but these numbers are not indicative of airwiss future earnings power due to the enormous amount of impending government support
 on a normalized basis using  flight volumes airwis will generate  million in annual unlevered net income for a  net income margin this margin improvement is substantial over prepandemic levels which were razor thin when factoring in onetime addbacks the improvement is purely driven by the elimination of  million in annual rent expense with an incremental stepup in depreciation this move by management was clearly marginaccretive for the business normalized earnings will be profitable

valuation  book value approach

 yearend  airwis had  of book value per share for todays book value we add back current and longterm deferred revenue m which will come in as earnings in  we also add back the m Pogo Producing Company (PPP) loan which is forgivable we arrive at an adjusted book value of  per share on top of this airwis will receive  million from psp and psp to offset payroll in  adjusting for psp and psp we arrive at our base case of  per share
 furthermore preowned crjs sell for  million even if hrbr were to liquidate selling the  aircraft at  of the market price would generate enough cash to cover the market cap adding in the  million of net cash would yield a share price of 

valuation  earnings power approach

 at normalized net income of  million applying a x multiple and assuming a dollarfordollar conversion of  million in net cash we arrive at a  share price
 at x we obtain a  share price
 the discrepancy in price and value for this business is too large to ignore

catalysts

 the primary catalyst for a rerating is capital allocation the majority shareholder in the business is richard bartlett who controls  of shares outstanding
 inside ownership is  demonstrating strong alignment of incentives management has chosen to stay in the dark for  years but after posting strong financial results and attracting substantial investor interest they cannot remain in the shadows
 management has announced a share buyback program where they will set aside an additional  million each month to repurchase shares  million an astounding  of market cap has already been set aside for the program
 while shares have yet to be repurchased management is creating a war chest whose value will soon be unlocked by shareholders another capital allocationrelated catalyst would be the announcement of a special dividend
 with  million in net cash and a  million market cap simple capital allocation decisions surrounding a dividend or repurchases would prove to be imminent and tangible catalysts prompting a proper multiple rerating
 the call option catalyst is an uplisting to a major stock exchange from their current otc existence
 an additional catalyst is the release of the next quarterly filing the disclosure of  million of government funding from psp  causing net cash balance to explode from  million yearend  to  million today will be an eyeopening result to investors

conclusion

hrbr is worth base case  and bull case  the share price will increase as a result of upcoming earnings announcements which will point out the fact that the business received a m check in cold hard cash from the government earlier in  dividends and share buybacks will provide further upside potential overall air wisconsin provides one of the strongest riskreward opportunities in the market today with a substantial margin of safety with downside protection

disclaimer nothing contained in this post should be construed as investment advice",64,im intrigued but i hate the upside being people dont know about it yet it can fly under the radar perpetually,"an additional catalyst is the release of the next quarterly filing the disclosure of  million of government funding from psp  causing net cash balance to explode from  million yearend  to  million today will be an eyeopening result to investors

you have no idea how much cash theyll report having on the books when they file further net cash balance is pretty meaningless 

this thing reads like a creative writing piece","it feels like this is being pumped

i wish people would post their E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) and avoid using words like astonishing etc i dont need you to qualify your case with hyperbolic words if the case is good it will present it self

also i dont need to be told something is too large to ignore why dont you let me be the judge of whether i should ignore it or not

if the business is undervalued and profitable you want people to ignore it so you can build up a big position stock prices follow earnings in the long term if i had to wait  years for the market to figure it out im fine edit you say theyll do buybacks so this means you want the share price undervalued while they are buying it back last thing you want is the company doing buybacks on over priced shares

ill give the benefit of the doubt and say that the E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) seems well thought out but there is too much salesmanship

best of luck with it"
Economic indicators,SecurityAnalysis,Building more sophisticated financial models and understanding operating leverage,"hi everyone first time poster here would love to hear the communitys thoughts on how they create more useful financial models specifically how do you look at fixed vs variable cost breakdowns to estimate incremental margins and how do you estimate ebitda or ebit breakeven points its very nice when ebitda breakevens andor contribution margins are laid out in Ingersoll-Rand Company (IR) presentations and the like but thats the exception and not the norm

im a big fan of avoiding precision bias so ill usually focus on more qualitative factors than the typical trend extrapolation that dominates a lot of investment analysis i see quite a few analysts setting sga to an average percentage of sales over the last    years and then adding small incremental improvements per year without a strong grounding in the unit economics of the business and this seems like lunacy to me but qualitative factors dont matter much without a quantitative framework  for example knowing that theres a lot of excess capacity is great but its most helpful if i can understand it in the context of what incremental margins look like

i sometimes try extrapolating ebit growth divided by revenue growth to get a sense for operating leverage but its a very rube goldberg way of doing things and not necessarily indicative of whats going to happen going forward another way is looking at competitors with lower relative cost structures and estimating that the target improves over a number of years to hit that target but this option isnt always useful or even available sometimes theres no applicable competitorpeer group ill also compare quarteroverquarter increases of ebit and revenue and can get a sense for incremental ebit margin that way this last way seems like the best way to me but theres usually so much noise that its not frequently accurate

anyone else have a good way for quantifying this sort of marginal analysis",12,"hola amigo an approach i like to take is examining margins in the past  years and observing where last years was with respect to different statistics max min median etc from here i observe the amount of time between last years or Life Time Fitness (LTM) performance with respect to each of the aforementioned 

for example i examine hypotheticalco Life Time Fitness (LTM)   i examine General Motors Corporation (GM)  cogs components eg rent inventory sga  revenue ebit margin ebitda margin etc and see where each cost item is relative to the most max the company has paid for each expense item if hypoco is at its lowest expense structure during the Life Time Fitness (LTM) with respect to the last  years for lets saysga i can assume that i probably cant assume much margin expansion in forward projections or utilize this perspective w respect to base case bear case bull case

if im quickly modeling a company id set base case margins  median of last  years or  or  bull case to th percentile bear case to min and extrapolate potential projections  create a quick and dirty future share price analysis on the basis of those outputs can be helpful too examining vs historical valuations evebit pe or another approach is interpolating margins to the aforementioned medianmaxmin in  years","okay actually another question is how the hell do you guys do gross margin 

like i think that is the scariestmost volatile margin out of the whole latter especially in certain industries drammicron comes to mind is there even close to a single way that makes sense to make meaningful assumptions based on unit economics",you cant time the market
Economic indicators,SecurityAnalysis,Booking Holdings (BKNG) appears susceptible to short-term downside. Hoping for feedback,"hi rsecurityanalysis  big fan of the informative content on this sub i hope to learn by doing presenting my findings on booking holdings Suncor Energy (Inc.)bkng i hope yall find this informative and valuable and look forward to a good discussion in the comments further any feedback would be really appreciated see my writeup below

 bkng optimistic valuation sidesteps possible travel recovery mishaps

a quick history

booking holdings bkng has been a fantastic investment as globetrotting travel becomes an accessible lifestyle  invested in  would have become  by the decades end in the wake of the great recession individuals buying power has exploded thanks to online platformsaggregators consequently offline channels demise eg  has further contributed to growth however marketshare theft begins to slow  as travel agencies cease operations the homogeneity of options available further favours bkngs business model however the rise of airbnb might contradict that further travel trends of the past decade can be read 

business model

xb



high margin opportunities are rare within travel and tourism the sector bkng possess a highmargin business model serving a typically lowmargin sector

booking holdings portfolio contains market leaders differentiated by business model andor geography

 bookingcom  the pice de rsistance it is the  travel platform across Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA) and europe
 agoda  ranking  as market leader in east asia
 rentalcarscom   platformonly unlike enterprise and hertz car rental aggregator
 pricelinecom  the once flagbearer of aggregators focussed on us and canada
 kayak  successor to pricelinecom Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA) and china are top markets
 opentable  restaurant booking and management services in primarily Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA) and canada

in western markets notable competition remains expedia Expedia, Inc. (EXPE) whilst tripcom group tcom focusses on asia its distinct businesses highlight their aspiration of  where a universe of services delivers an endtoend vacation experience

revenue segments explained

 agency revenues  commission taken without handling of payments  eg the booking and the sale are disparate
 merchant revenues  commission is taken in addition to payment processing fees etc
 advertising and other revenues  insite advertising featured referrals fees by kayak and bookings management services provided by opentable

xb



aggregators suffer from low differentiation meaning that kayak nor priceline are dominant however remain important for directing users to platforms such as bookingcom or agoda ownership or minority stakes encourages aggregators to selectively direct

 expedia Expedia, Inc. (EXPE) has stakes in despegar latin america desp and trivago europe tvgo
 tripcom group tcom has stakes in tongcheng elong china and makemytrip india mmyt
 booking holdings bkng has stake in tripcom group tcom  theres always a bigger fish

its dominant position worldwide combined with its vision make bkng an attractive business

shortterm aftermath of a pandemic

i believe the covid virus will impact global travel more than the  terror attacks the sars epidemic and the  global financial crisis combinedglen d fogel CNOOC Limited (CEO) of booking holdings april 

this may sound fearinducing but in reality this statement says very little modern tourism has shown remarkable  to past shocks like past crises covids impact can be separated into two hurdles to be overcome the initial shock and the tail the tourismrelated impact events mentioned by fogel are assessed

 september th terror attacks  day event created uncertainty of global travel using aeroplanes the sector generally recovered with  year but ny tourism took 
  sars outbreak  multiyear regional outbreak however chinese tourism was not globally significant accounting for  of all spending vs  today
 global financial crisis  sector ramifications felt later however growth returned in 

these events lack global severity or were felt over either the shortterm or longterm the  characterises a shock event with longterm sector damage all nations within the region  by  apart from worsthit indonesia where visitations returned by  this is further testament to the sectors ability to withstand the most brutal of events

xb



further  indicates a recovery europeanfocussed platforms hrsde and automotive rental platforms rentalcarscom  carrentalscom regardless average visits are down  since january even after a may rebound

this information may be received as comforting however the shortterm outlook continues to remain choppy a full sector recovery in  is unlikely the majority of bkng sales stem from hardhit Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA) and europe which  predicts will not share a chinesestyle rebound moreover consider the seasonality of booking periods vacations are normally booked  days in  implying  under normal circumstances  vacations up to september are mostly accounted for heavy sector discounting will spur some but the importance of h sales remains undeniable

xb



the above table presents a base scenario revenue change of  in  assumptions are made in blue

long term aftermath of an economic slowdown

the second sectorwide question refers to when will normality resume  indicated by sales resuming to  levels research by  points towards a multiyear recovery



beyond when focussing on the longterm prospects of bkng its fate is tied to namely sector growth and competition

the exemplary track record of bkng tells one possible story a rising tide lifts all boats tells another possible story as globetrotting tourism becomes attainable to half of the worlds households by  sector growth is expected to outpace economic growth

xb



if bkng is to capitalize on this capturing the asian market is crucial chinese dominance will extend  only  of the population are passport holders forecast to be  by  agoda is the marketleader here however strong liquidity enables inorganic growth levers to be pulled the then priceline group acquired bookingcom in  for m a drop in the ocean compared to their current balance with low interest rates this should offset risks brought by increased debt



edit 







when assessing competition mode of booking ie online is unlikely to change however preferred platform may management and others  are mainly directed towards big tech firms facebook fb and google googl due to their ability to integrate travel booking into other products eg google maps low switching costs mean booking holdings established presence will provide little defence against the  antitrust concerns in  and the limited presence of big tech in asia provides bkng with valuable time to strategize a defence further mediumterm tailwinds are unlikely to be derailed as a result



valuation

xb



bkng and peers have been reluctant to issue forward guidance as investors look beyond   forward earnings will be used to arrive at a current valuation

xb



current valuation favours a   revenue decline and a  recovery trading around  provides little room for error a decline to sub levels would provide suitable entry

 shortterm  Portugal Telecom SGPS, S.A . (PT)   hold

xb



notable dcf assumptions are noted

 tax rate  remains at 
 riskfree rate   us y tbill 
    y avg oecd members gdp growth 
 perpetual operating margin   similar to fy

regardless of the scenario there is little difference in dcf valuation perpetual growth used is conservative given sector growth and discount rates reflect current market reality a current share value of below  seems reasonable when taking a longterm view on an investment providing an expected annual return of approximately 

 longterm  Portugal Telecom SGPS, S.A . (PT)   buy

conclusion

the travel bug is not a western phenomenon the continued rise of asian holidaymakers will solidify this covid has rattled tourism and will crush nearterm earnings yet booking holdings bkng possesses sizable competitive advantages in the following ways

 dominant position globally
 respected platforms and a  to pivot focus to the top performers
 lowcost highmargin business model
 longterm tailwinds within a resilient sector
 strong financial position cash balance comfortably covers e expenses inorganic growth possible

bkng has proven to be a wellrun business despite this the market has shown its ruthlessness as such a  pullback to attractive shortterm levels is possible for the longterm bkng investor competition will continue to be fierce booking holdings arguably won the battle for the west whilst attentions will turn east they must be careful not to lose focus on home turf in asia tripcom group tcom remains their biggest threat however in the early stages there will be spoils for all lower sector growth is also concern however unlikely yet investors should take comfort knowing in a scenario where expected perpetual growth halves bkng remains within the shortterm Portugal Telecom SGPS, S.A . (PT) investors ought to continue loving vacations as much as everyone else

when a momentum stock loses momentum and misses earnings in my experience it is usually fatal i am not a huge student of the stockindustry but in my opinion they are at the point where they either do something i dont know what which rights the ship or this is going to go on for    years and is existential the only bright spot is that the new CNOOC Limited (CEO) is someone who has been there a while usually when the CNOOC Limited (CEO) switches they need a clueless outsider to step into the meat tenderiserso maybe there is hope

but the return on brain damage is usually minimal i used to look at a ton of these situations it is kind of where most people end up after they get jaded with netnets and shitty low pe stocks and never saw any inefficiencies your upside is usually  at best and you make that almost never maybe  in  or  most stocks will just keep unwinding over  years and you lose half your money  in the market gets these ones right almost always in my opinion being on the other side is a far better trade","biggest worry in my case around the ota moat thesis is the potential entrance of google in this space lots of people acknowledge that google has a stranglehold on search and thus by proxy in ota search  there is definitely an existential threat to the Expedia, Inc.

bynd seems to have a major market share and frankly produces a product which is unrivaled at the consumer level other than impossible foods which only sells to resturantes they also hold a sizable cash position which they intend to deploy to aquire other brands and from what iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) read have low debt this market share plus their aquisition potential lead me to believe they can be the biggest player in the growing vegan foods industry in the future they currently run the vegan beef market and their new vegan sausage line is gaining market share fast with the addition of possibly a vegan dairy line beyond milk which is currently b in sales worldwide they can be a juggernaut with the aquisition or partnership with a company like miyokos creamery small vegan creamery that makes dairy alternitive which is clearly the best from a quality perspective but lacks in supply chain and resources compared to larger companies like daiay that would be a dangerous combo to the market

edit also a good amount of people are dogmatically opposed to veganism and the average investor who has these oppositions to veganism might also allow these biases to have a unreasonably negative outlook when deciding to invest in a company like bynd leading to deflated pricing is this possible

Stock market,DueDiligence,Danaos Corporation (DAC) DD,"update 


hey im looking for feedback on my E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) as i am learning how to write them this should be an easier one since dac is the number one stock on seekingalpha and has a strong buy rating at zachs any input is appreciated

danaos corporation dac due diligence

dac is a textbook turnaround 

what they do

danaos corporation dac is a container ship leasing company founded in  headquartered in greece listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) their fleet includes  containerships of varying size they lease their ships out for longer term contracts to ship liner companies who run freight internationally 

who they are

insiders own  of the float the CNOOC Limited (CEO) is the son of the founder the board is stacked with engineers which is a good thing in my book 

specific market

the containership leasing rates just skyrocketed in response to shipping demand picking up from the covid bounce back dac just released  of their  ships at rates nearly x what they were leased at beforehand the average length of these new charters is about  years there are no new ships being built at the moment as the shipping industry came out of a bust cycle recently it takes two years for a ship to be built so rates will not be largely affected by competition in the near future the performance of the sector is showing this marine shipping has been the best performing industrial sector up  in the past three months

financials

net asset value of  per share if they liquidated today their assets would be worth more to an equity investor than the stock pe of  AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. (AMP) peg of  both are under the marine shipping industry averages pe  AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. (AMP) peg  gross operating and profit margins are all above industry average at    respectively 

technicals

setting new highs since last august trading above sma  AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. (AMP)  solid upward corridor pattern back in its hay day dac was trading above  a share short interest is at  

why i like the stock

dacs stock got pounded by the restructuring and recent stock dilution since then debt has been cut in half and a share buyback has taken place they have their priorities right they are coming out on the other side of this to a boom cycle in the shipping industry with a serious moat that will hold for the midterm also shipping isnt a sexy or exciting business this may be one of the few areas that hasnt been overbought and run up to crazy multiples already with the covid bounce back this is a toyear turnaround play for me dac is listed at a strong buy rating at zachs and seekingalpha has dac listed as their number one recommendation 

downsides

im not a fan of a company headquartered in greece they dont have the best reputation but hey that plays into the low market price of the stock international shipping is dependent on international politics which could change at a whim but bidens trade policies appear to be pretty internationally friendly the  refinancing and  share dilutions left the company with a black eye

Trading strategy,DueDiligence,DD Norwegian Air Shuttle,"due diligence norwegian air shuttle 

the norwegian air shuttle hereafter referred to as nas 

nas has a market cap of  billion dollar which translates to  billion Nokia Corporation (NOK) 
norwegian air shuttle  
nas have a high debt to equity ratio  as of may   which implies high volatility of the stock and put us in riskier territory especially in account of more recent findings and future projections  more on that later 


total revenue in the third quarter of  was Nokia Corporation (NOK)  million  a decrease of  percent unit revenue increased by  percent following a yield increase of  percent and a decreased load factor by  percentage points average sector length decreased by  percent

	threat of new entrants 
in the airline segment which craves huge amounts of realinvestments make it a difficult industry to break into but if we focus on the lowcost segment of airlines there are first of a lot of other airlines that would want to swallow up that market share of whish nas is losing its grip furthermore the threat of new entrants is particularly high since airlines that are not primarily in the lowcost segment can easily break in as they can leverage existing expertise cash flow and brand identity to push in the capital requirement are as mentioned really high but the riskfactor in this regard isnt completely new ventures but rather already existing companies which have managed the pandemic better and would easily take over the current lease agreements held by nas for the routes and airstrips 

	threat of substitutes
the threat of subsidy is generally not very high while some of the shorter routes could be substituted for faster trains but there arent really a substitute for longer travels that is for airlines in general however lowcost airlines like nas could very well be substituted for other types of commercial flights 
 
the years since  have been challenging for the airline industry various geopolitical and macroeconomic issues impacted the trading environment and intense competition and a rising cost environment notably increases in fuel prices but also labor costs in some cases squeezed margins of all operators in addition terrorist attacks in barcelona and london and the brexit vote dulled consumer confidence and dampened demand norwegian air shuttle 

 
nas have been particularly affected by this because they tried to get ahead of a lot of other lowcost airlines  they bought their fleet in bulk and quickly expanded to multiple destinations this made them really vulnerable to a decline in air travel because of the huge amounts debt they undertook so as well as the macroeconomic headwinds and the crushing effects of the pandemic nas are up for a big challenge to say in the least 

however the globalization definitely decreased its curve because if the previously stated macroeconomic issues along with the pandemic but this is in my opinion a temporarily decline because together with a growing population which craves more products and more food and the way to make that happen are with more globalization which mean economies of scale this is in other words a necessity for our growing world we will see the same kind of closeness to far off destinations as we have seen before and this is done with airlines 

nass perceived level of product differentiation is increasing by the restructuring with a bigger focus on nordic countries and less routes which will yield bigger market shares in the nordics and they dont have to fight with a lot bigger and diverse airlines like ryan air in the nordics they will compete with airlines like sas and finn air and nas unique lowcost model will help them stay in the lead  

	bargaining power of customers
as mentioned in the quote above intense competition and a rising cost environment have made the bargaining power of consumers higher it is hard for the airlines to differentiate and or make customers exclusive when people are looking for a flight plan they arent screening each airline company since it is a lot easier to just go to a website like momondo or the like so the different airlines are almost completely interchangeable 

that is within the same market segment but nas has as they say it a unique lowcost model high quality efficient and at low cost which i am very inclined to agree with sure there are a lot of other low cost airlines but few have the same quality aircraft and services as nas comparing for example ryan air and nas nas provides a lot more customer satisfaction in  nas was for the fifth year in a row named by passengers in the skytrax rating ten the worlds best lowcost longhaul airline in addition to europes secondbest lowcost airline after being named best Swiss Exchange (SIX) years in a row in 

	bargaining power of suppliers
the groups financial results are affected by the evolution of the market price of jet fuel as fuel costs are the single largest cost item for the group jet fuel costs represented  percent of the groups operating costs before aircraft leasing and depreciation in  the operating results of the group can be materially affected by changes in the price and availability of jet fuel
boeing the supplier of  max aircrafts have been sued by nas because of extensive engine problems and were therefor grounded until clearance to fly from aviation authorities however a reintroduction of these planes could create some upside risk to expected growth according to norwegian air shuttle  

	competitive rivalry
powerful competitive strategy which could potentially be realized by adhering to porters work on low cost versus differentiation
nas has a competitive advantage against other airlines because of their lowcost strategy coupled with their fleet which is one of the most modern around so as a passenger you can choose one of the cheapest flights while having amenities usually associated with airlines on the other side of the price spectrum if you compare nas with ryan air ryan air is a lot bigger and a lot more financially stable they have already bounced back to their precovid stock price but worse customer relations in the nordics in which nas has a stronghold for example you cant even fly ryan air from stockholms main airport as nas are descaling and putting larger focus on the nordic market they will benefit greatly from this and give them a better chance of survival  
as for other competitive advantages while nas have been hit harder than most their restructure plan shows great promise which involves a big restructuring of the company to match the new market they laid down over  routes sold  aircrafts in  and made a decision to further reduce their fleet to focus more on the nordic market in which they have a lot more marketing presence and more loyal customers since nas caters more to the nordic climate and landscape also in close cooperation with local businesses and tourism nas also went under an organizational transformation with a new board and group management with a new strategy of profitability rather than growth the financial restructuring opened up for governmental aid and different kinds of creditor protection the fist part of the restructuring was successful and they gained reliefs by two of their main subsidiaries filed for examinership in ireland a report by deloitte recommends full protection from its creditors based on the restructuring which will yield profitability by  
although nas will be smaller then before it is expected that when or if nas manages to stay afloat until the restrictions have eased up that it will be a lot stronger within the new segment and gain market shares within the nordics as they build a more profitable base before a possible future growth 

strengths 
nas managed a full company restructuring which gave improved balance sheet with Nokia Corporation (NOK)  billion and is planning further improvements
   achieved an equity ratio of 
new board and new strategy for a smaller but more profitable company 

weaknesses 
denied additional governmental help which is a really important issue since without a full protection from creditors it is believed that nas will be out of business in the first quarter of  
   there are still big debts because of their now scraped plan of huge expansion and that debt made then vulnerable even before the pandemic 
   there are still travel restrictions in effect and a quick and sudden jump in air travels are unlikely 

opportunities 
the vaccines are really coming together and if they are successful we could se a surge in air travel demand which will cause a chain reaction with investors willing to aid airlines and in this financial climate things move quicker than ever and can possibly give enough investments to make the airlines profitable again 
   max  are no longer grounded  high possibility of a settlement in their suit against boeing 
   the capital restructuring might enable more governmental aid 

threats 
the option to extend creditor protection could be denied and the amounting debt is then called upon which will effectively put nas into bankruptcy 
   even if the creditor protection is approved it is not going to matter if the boarders arent opening up soon and people think it is okay to fly again
   projections for passenger revenue for the industry as a whole are even when accounting for the fastest possible recovery negative  for a moderate recovery negative  and the projection for the slowest recovery negative  these projections speak heavily towards a gloomy outlook for nas 

conclusion 
to conclude from the text an investment in nas are coupled with high risk which is reflected in the stock price which has declined from about  Nokia Corporation (NOK) during  to  Nokia Corporation (NOK) as of november   the pe ratio is  volatility is  ps is  
 
but what i conclude from my analysis is that while it is a big risk the reward can be incredible an investment of about  would equal ca  nas and if they manage not to belly up during  they will most likely pull out of this nose dive and be able to start serving customers again which would mean a big surge in the whole industry and a company like nas have an incredible possibility to gain thousands precent lets say the stock gain half of its worth in  that  would yield a bit more that  my position is that the stock is a bit oversold at the moment and people have dismissed nas and that the risk to reward ratio makes a smaller bet on this product worthwhile because the thing is nas only have to stay alive one more year to almost make their recovery a certainty so after taking into account nas as a smallercompany and stock dilution i wouldnt consider selling within  years 

sources",11,norwegian air shuttle has a market cap of b while american airlines has a market cap of b i think we can all agree that aal is significantly probably x bigger than nas therefore if you want to bet on the future of aviation aal is better,deleted,what would you consider indicators that the likelihood of them surviving is increasing eg should they make it through the first quarter  how much do you think that increases their chances of survival and what other indicators should we be on the look out for

the flight guidance system

the stock traded between  and  precovid it is currently trading around support at  in fact the last time it traded around these lows was in december  when the company voluntarily withdrew their bla application for the viaskin peanut product due to insufficient level of detail about the manufacturing and quality controls keep in mind the new CNOOC Limited (CEO) joined in november  and he is a thorough man the price fell from  to  and they were subsequently sued the hearing is pending in new jersey previous to this the price dropped from  to  in october  when the company announced that the viaskin peanut clinical trial failed to achieve statistical significance in the lower end of the  confidence interval by a small margin target was  results indicated 

competitor aimt market cap b benefited from both of these price moves but lost the gains as swiftly as they came in fact they were unlucky that the approval of their oral tablets for allergy treatment was on january st but they didnt benefit from the price move due to covid furthermore their drug  and is still dogged by  like abdominal pain vomiting nausea tingling in the mouth itching including in the mouth and ears cough runny nose throat irritation and tightness hives wheezing and shortness of breath and anaphylaxis this drug must still undergo a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems ie it can only be administered in a controlled environment parents have to take their kids to a certified hospital every  weeks and the administering nurses doctors and patients all have to register for the rems

wallet situation

in their  the company indicated that their cash runway  million can last through 

the financials are lacklustre in the past  years revenue has stagnated at around m although they beat estimates however since the new CNOOC Limited (CEO) was appointed eps grew  in the first year and  in the second year and they have secured m in financing not too bad not too good either but given the ceos strong track record the good things are yet to come

the rocket fuel

viaskin technology is currently under review by the fda taget action date for viaskin peanut is set for august  viaskin egg  viaskin milk will follow soon after these products have a us fda fast track designation you may ask why a french company is developing treatment therapies in the us and the answer would be that because on average the process of drug review is  months faster in the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA) than in the eu if the fda accepts the test data and gives a way forward on a date for inspection of the manufacturing facilities then the race for allergy treatments would be blown wide open it could probably soar back to the  range where it was in  before that damned bla withdrawal or we can dream about a saturn landing and aim for  where it was in  before the clinical trials failed by the small margin nine  analysts have given it a shortterm price target of  and midterm target of  but i like the ceos track record and i prefer to dream bigger

some other windows to to stargaze

  many since february  and some as recently as june  baker brothers m shares arrowpoint asset management m perceptive advisors m boxer capital m morgan stanley m amundi m and fidelity k sabby missed this rocket which makes stargazing all the more beautiful in total institutions own  of the shares
 there are also also recent acquisitions of stock in in june  by a number of index funds like ftihx imrfx  jccix
 the fda had questions about the impact of the patch adhesion to its efficacy remember no safety issues were reported during the clinical trial the company has already responded to this query but the fda has given no further feedback apart from that the data was being reviewed at this point it is a coin flip game high risk high reward
 the data mentioned in point iii above has been published in multiple peerreviewed scientific publications  and  and abstract all reviews show positive data
 the company recently trimmed down its workforce something that is notoriously difficult to do in france and scaled down other clinical programs in order to focus on the viaskin peanut product which is coming up for review on august th this simply indicates that they are very serious about this niche or that they are prepared for a possible delay of the fdas decision
  in a deal worth m to develop more product candidates eg viaskin milk nestl is the largest food company in the world with over  brands and generates  billion plus in revenue each year since  however  they are personally invested in this peanut allergy product and this collaboration has not been affected by the covid crisis fun fact nestle also owns  of aimt the competitor company they are hedging their bets
 skin patch therapy is potentially more marketable among the market segment that they are targeting childen  infants than pills in addition they would have potentially less side effects because the active compound gets directly into the bloodstream and does not get absorbed via the liver
 consider that it is a french company and the big influence france has in the eu if they get approved they might get approval support from the french government too",4,im liking it however what caused the major drop near the end of june was it an offering also that volume is so low bruh which could be a good or bad thing depending on how she moves with above average volume otherwise i think this E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) is nicely done and ill definitely be putting this on my watch list,nan,nan

 swot analysis

strengths

 brand image  this company isnt going anywhere any time soon they hold a reputation that often precedes them when it comes to quality and performance
 product variation  the company is involved in multiple industries and products they operate within civil aerospace defence aerospace marine and nuclear to name a few
 few competitors  due to the high skilled workforce required and high entry costs into the respective markets coupled with the economies of scale that rolls royce has access to it will be incredibly hard to displace them in many of the industries that they are involved with rolls royce also often wins government contracts that provide the business with further stability for example a  billion pound contract with the uk government for nuclear submarine cores 

weaknesses

 covid  the business has taken a big hit from the pandemic as demand for many of the products it sells has fallen most notably in the aerospace sector this is coupled with the fact that now that many businesses are weakened financially they may not feel that the extra expense of rr products are worth it as they operate on a high price high quality pricing strategy it may be that businesses look to cut corners on a cheaper alternative

opportunities

 increased focus on automation the company has really been investing in building selfdriven cars self driven evs look to be the future of auto travel and rr is at the cutting edge of the automation required to operate these vehicles it may be that this is deployed in their own line of cars or that the technology is sold to other car manufacturers
 focus on green and hybrid vehicles  predictably the company is focused on trying to build green and hybrid vehicles and the valuations of similar companies has risen dramatically as progress in this area is made if rr makes some progress catching up to established players such as tesla then there could be a potential upside in share price
 new forays into space exploration  rr has recently signed a contract with the uk space agency to look at the possibility of using nuclear power options in space exploration this is extremely exciting as it shows intent in a sector that looks to make some great growth in the coming years and rr seems to be close to the head of that

threats

 focus on sustainability  one of the issues with rr is that it does draw some of its income from civil aerospace following on from the pandemic and the rise of zoom ideas such as the great reset are bringing air travel under fresh scrutiny it is possible that the industry will not recover to PartnerRe Ltd. (PRE) pandemic heights for some time due to the carbon footprint that flights cause
 cost of raw materials  some raw material costs rising have been a minor issue in the supply chain

 potential upside

rolls royce seems focused on the future if they can mount a good recovery from the covid crash it seems there could still be a long way to go in terms of share price a share currently trades for under a  which shows a great investing opportunity as the stock may find its way back to the  per share range rr can also be seen as a very long term play this company is on the cutting edge of research and development and it is not inconceivable that new technologies such as electric aircraft may allow them to make leaps and bounds in the coming years

yahoo finance analysts provide a very mixed bag of recommendations in the attached image although the analysts price targets show a very different story as the lowest estimate  is still far greater than the current 

 too long; didn't read

the company may ride the wave out of the pandemic in the short to medium term and looks great in the long term

rr does not make money by selling their commercial engines funny enough they bill their customers based on flight hours with so many planes grounded that is their largest weakness  nothing to do with the price of the engines

also worth noting that the alternatives arent necessarily cheaper their only real competitors pw and ge

xb

opportunities

rr does not own or operate rr automotive that is owned by bmw after being split off decades ago this makes  of your opportunities meaningless rr holdings rycey  rrl are not working on any cars Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) autonomous or hybrid 

they are working on electric and alternativefuel jet engines as well as have finished ground testing the worlds fastest electric propeller airplane

Options trading,DueDiligence,Performing DD,howdy folks newish investor here started last year just purchasing shares but have been doing research on options trading lately i just wanted to ask this group what sorts of websites are popular for doing your E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) or if it varies depending on the ticker youre looking for information on,9,"first stop for me is twitter see if anyone is pumping the ticker 

next stop is check out the daily weekly monthly chart see if something is forming or whats happening with that 

next stop is market cap compare that to its competitors if you can is this thing under or over valued 

from there hit the message boards like ihub and yahoo dig around 

im really looking for red flags what people are really saying 

then start looking at their own social media and website 

how professional do they look how many followers 

thats a pretty comprehensive way that i do it 

not sure if i answered your question","as the above posts say i also search google and change the settings to display results from the last month then last  months check recent buyssells on the markets look at finance sheets to see if the company are in a decent financial position or if are about to to turn profitable i avoid most stocks mentioned on reddit or do my own E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) on them as everybody buys them and they normally crash within a week pump and dumps look into the directors of the company in question have they had previous successfailings are they in a saturated market or are they bringing something new check a companies patents etc

i mainly trade uk stocks i would of added sites i use but they are aimed at London Stock Exchange (LSE) and uk companies so wouldnt be much use for us stocks but im guessing the methods are the same be as in depth as you can so you can make an educated decision on whether they company in question has growth potential or are undervalued and ready to break out

most of all strip all emotion out of your E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) dont ignore a red flag just because you like the look of the companystock",sorry i cannot help you other than to say i regularly check google finance and yahoo finance i am also curious what some more experienced users have to say especially in regard to finding relevant news and catalysts

digital transformation failure

this is some old news but it is important to understand what went wrong in  general electric created a subdivision called ge digital they hoped to dominate the industrial internet however ge was slow to digitally transform most companies transformed in the s and mid ge dumped billions of dollars into this project and appointed thousands of employees to oversee the transformation so where did they go wrong ge moved away from its core business and spread its resources too thin they focused on quantity instead of quality wellknownges companies like apple microsoft and google who dominate the tech industry made it hard to compete

porters five forces model

 threats of new entrants
    increased competition in the aviation industry
    barrier to entry healthcare regulation from hipaa and fda
    barriers to entry renewable energy lack of infrastructure fewer government subsidies compared to fossil fuels
    the overall threat of new entrants is weak due to the high cost of entry
 supplier bargaining power
    ge has an extensive list of suppliers which can be found 
       the most notable suppliers are m 3M Company (MMM) honeywell international Honeywell International Inc. (HON) boeing ba exxonmobil Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) and berkshire hathaway brka
       a lot of these suppliers products overlap with each other meaning ge has many options
 international competition
    competition is stiff from companies like siemens and m
 threat of substitutes
    there are few substitutes in the market so the threat is minimal

general electric formed a head and shoulders pattern starting on june   and ended on july   this pattern was soon followed by a breakdown since then the stock has been operating in a horizontal channel with resistance at  and  look to enter the market around the lower resistance mark wed also like to highlight the month of march there was a lot of positive news during march which explains the increase in ge share price reference the timeline for more information



bullish case

 CNOOC Limited (CEO) larry culp driving down debt and liabilities 
 lack of substitutes in the market

bearish case

 digital transformation failure

conclusion

general electric has struggled these past  years which is partly due to the digital transformation failure ge spread its resources too thin and moved away from its core business ge could have been more profitable if they focused on developing their money makers in the healthcare aviation and energy industries that being said ge is now focusing more on those industries Guess?, Inc. (GES) acquisition of Bank of New York Company, Inc. (The) (BK) medical is a big step in the right direction for healthcare profit aside from that the new genx jet engines are quite impressive the increased fuel efficiency and reduced carbon emissions are attractive to customers amid the growing global commitment to reach carbon neutrality ge has been known to create terrific jet engines back in wwii their j engine dominated the skies if you look up the bestmost popular jet engines in history youll find out they were made by ge ge has been making some major moves in the renewable energy industry most recently in the wind power sector emphasis on global carbon neutrality will have a positive impact on general electric in the future CNOOC Limited (CEO) larry culp is committed to driving down debt and liabilities long term debt debt has decreased by  in five years and total liabilities have decreased by  in five years in order to drive down these numbers the CNOOC Limited (CEO) has slashed dividends if youre looking for a similar company with a higher yield dividend we suggest you look into united technologies  or m  despite general electrics performance these past  years we believe that ge can bounce backif general electric focuses on its core business healthcare aviation and energy it will be very profitable

macro market view

in december  the united nations held a global summit on climate and environment the un stressed the importance of reaching carbon neutrality as global temperatures increase this is easier said than done at the heart of co emissions are oil and coal thirdworld countries that dont have access to clean energy are unable to pledge to carbon neutrality oil prices have hit a threeyear high this is due to the global supply chain bottleneck the increase in oil prices has shifted consumer demand towards cleaner energy specifically natural gas on top of that the us is in the process of passing the bipartisan infrastructure bill which plans to invest b into electric grids this will allow more access to clean energy in the us

technical analysis



looking at the month chart for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the  mark and solid support around the  mark a buying opportunity may come up if we see Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) dip down near its support range bullish breakthrough at  and bearish breakthrough at 

conclusion

the biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of  golf courses the solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank are only scratching the surface tsms green marketing strategy does little to address the issue at hand the semiconductor industry is expected to grow by  with water consumption expecting to increase by  aside from this issue Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) has a comparative advantage over its rival intel Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) has a significantly higher market cap lower total debt and fewer liabilities Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) doesnt pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business intel has mediocre dividends at best Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) will be a trilliondollar company in the next  years bidens b subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the us in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader tsms new b fabs in arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from us subsidies Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) has a positive outlook for the next  years

Risk management,DueDiligence,$DAC - Analysis and DD - A 2023 Deep Value Play,"for a more indepth analysis i have also posted in the search of value forum link to my post there 

introduction

the danaos corporation dac is a freight charter company it is heavily undervalued by numerous metrics  trading at a evebitda of   pb a x pe and a x debtequity multiple as a freight charter company which owns the majority of its vessels it is not directly subject to changing freight rates although it is exposed to changing supply and demand as well as high capital dependance companies in the shipping industry are often viewed as a risky investment due to low rocs and heavy competition  however this company is currently at a massive discount and its exposure to risk is limited as  of the current revenue is contracted until  at the high covid spot rates furthermore these contracts are with liners that are in great financial health due to the previous few years of high cash flows in the shipping industry as of june   the average contract for their fleet is at  months  million in share buybacks were announced in  of which  million have already been purchased currently there is a  annual dividend yield with a payout ratio of approximately 

general risks

the firm is at its highest ever point in free cash flow  contracted ebitda locked in contracts over the next  years are more than its current enterprise value with the high amount of earnings that are already locked in contracts the only valid risk at this time are the spot rates their vessels will be subject to in the future in the case of a recession however this risk only applies to the  of revenue that is not locked in future contracts going into the future newly imposed environmental regulations may cause reduced revenue when considering the fact that new vessels will be introduced to the market  onwards and environmental checks required for older ships may increase future costs i do anticipate that this risk is currently overblown for danaos because of its sizable young portion of its fleet given that it is a charter company and not a liner it faces less exposure to volatility the return on capital averages at  which is not a high amount the x Navistar International Corporation (NAV) multiple does provide significant downside protection however

management

dr john coustas is the current CNOOC Limited (CEO) and president of the company he assumed management of the company from his father who founded the company in  in  he holds degrees in marine engineering computer science and computer controls with a  stake CNOOC Limited (CEO) john coustas is the largest shareholder in comparison the second and third largest shareholders hold about  and  of the stock his stake likely means he is largely in charge of decisions made at the company given he has over  years in shipping experience with the firm he may place his main incentive on steady growth instead of attempting to maximize shareholder returns although this might be balanced by other incentives due to his large stake in the company the average age of a vessel on the danaos fleet is  years  for reference depreciation of these vessels starts at ages ranging from  years it is possible that current older vessels may be used for additional periods due to the obscenely high recent spot rates this may be reduced after the intiation of environmental regulation around  million was committed in  to building  new vessels which will be delivered in  prior to this another  second hand vessels were purchased for  million in  these second hand vessels have currently yielded around  in adjusted earnings the company was under extensive strain after the gcf until covid due to a high level of debt and low charter rates  this prior history may impact the actions which the management of the company undertake with their current cash

reliability of long term contract customer base

due to the recent increase in cash flows which shipping companies experienced during covid large numbers of shipping companies are in extremely historically healthy financial positions furthermore the majority of danaos contracts are industry standard charter contracts  this means that they are not cancellable and are not subject to renegotiation or change unless in the case of a restructuring or bankruptcy in past years during which the shipping industry was under far greater strain than it is now danaos received full compensation from zim when it restructured in  in addition to when hmm restructured in  in the form of equity however in the case of hanjins bankruptcy no vessel owners received compensation which contributed to danaos recording a net loss of  million in  down from a net profit of  million in  it is worth noting that the period was also of a general industry turndown Comerica Incorporated (CMA) General Motors Corporation (GM)  m sc  and hmm  were the  biggest charter contract companies for danaos in in the q earning call for GLOBAL SIGNAL INC (GSL) a danaos competitor with a customer base which partly overlaps with the firm ian webber CNOOC Limited (CEO) said  further we have industry standard charter contracts theyre noncancelable we only deal with the really good names weve never had a bad debt in GLOBAL SIGNAL INC (GSL) it kind of doesnt happen in our industry by and large anyway liner companies are desperate for these ships they need the charter fleet to run their scheduled services without the ships they dont have services so its in their own interest to behave properly and as george said theyre in the best financial shape theyve probably ever been in  this summarizes my conviction on the matter the already low risks of customer bankruptcy are also somewhat mitigated by the firms diverse customer base their largest customer accounts for  of their revenue followed by the second largest customer at approximately  this risk is already low because of the fact that liner companies have recently come out of a cash flow windfall

effect of containership availability on future charter rates and revenue

the magnitude of teu vessels scrapped decreased from highs in  to  in  to  in  the recent increase in charter rates has caused numerous charter firms to run older ships for additional time in spite of higher operational costs this increase in vessel deployment and utilization is further evidenced by the fact that the idle fleet ratio has fallen to  in recent years vessel orders have been placed with anticipated deliveries between  and the increase in danaos net shipping capacity is  supply of these ships face a diminishing threat due to environmental regulations which will soon require corrective antipollution modifications to a portion of  of the current world fleet which can be classified as aged danaos is at a smaller exposure to this risk because of a large number of young vessels it owns additionally the influx in supply of ecofriendly ships to the market in future years may have a damage on danaos revenue but the large number of noncancelable contracts provides protection against this the market share is currently concentrated amongst a smaller number of larger liner companies due to many smaller firms having faced bankruptcy in recent years  this increase in supply side power could allow the maintenance of higher freight and therefore charter rates which could have an adverse effect on the aforementioned supply shifters benefiting danaos to combat the constrictors of supply significant orders will be met from  and a sizable portion of these orders will be at a capacity over  teu while danaos may have a smaller risk of loss due to its orders which are under  teu

catalyst

Risk management,DueDiligence,MineHub ($MHUB.v $MHUBF)focused on mitigating inflation & reducing friction in global supply chains,"as inflation continues to rise its becoming more and more apparent that we need a shared digital ledger of information between all key supply chain partners in order to combat inefficiencies and reduce friction which is exactly what minehub mhubv mhubf provides

mhub is focused on transforming the performance of global supply chains and improving efficiency by reducing the friction in mining supply chains that occurs when information sharing and validation are done on physical paper 

plus mhub helps to measure and report esg indicators which is becoming increasingly important as we demand more from supply chains and as governments try to account for previously ignored externalities 

by enabling secure collaborations managing esg performance and reducing both costs and control risk while improving revenue and optimizing resources mhub has the ability to facilitate a technological shift in global supply chains that would significantly reduce the friction in the supply chain and mitigate inflation

Risk management,DueDiligence,Integrated Cyber Solutions Maximizing the Business Engaged with Cell Signaling (CSE: ICS),"to understand the effect of ai on all of us  business government and regular folks we need to understand the concept of industry 

industry  can be defined as the integration of intelligent digital technologies into manufacturing and industrial processes it encompasses a set of technologies that include industrial iot networks ai big data robotics and automation

xb



put another way industry  which refers to the fourth industrial revolution is the cyberphysical transformation of manufacturing the name is inspired by germanys industrie  a government initiative to promote connected manufacturing and a digital convergence between industry businesses and other processes

with the background set now how does ai fit in

first the growth of ai according to next move strategy consulting the artificial intelligence ai market is expected to show strong growth in the coming decade its value of nearly  billion us dollars is expected to grow twentyfold by  up to almost two trillion us dollars

eventually i will get to the effect of ai on the cybersecurity market but more context needs to be set as you know the same chip has two of ai the good and the bad i would add the ugly but that would be cheesy did it anyway

there are several ways to proxy this sector but you have to read to the end seriously

growth of cyberattacks

the  blog states some sobering cyberattack stats

 attacks set to double from  to 

 attack detection only  in the us

 cybercrime up  since covid

 cybercrime represents the greatest transfer of economic wealth in history

  of attacks target small businesses

 only  cyberattack ready

lots more stats none are very favourable for the cybertargets

on the positive side

generative ai enhances decisionmaking processes by providing valuable insights augmenting data analysis and enabling scenario simulations generative ai generates diverse and realistic options and helps decisionmakers explore alternative strategies assess potential outcomes and make informed choices

thats all good but for investors and interested others we are more interested in how to stop or markedly mitigate devastating  a relative term   the needle and the damage done neil young 

given the massive growth of cyber attacks noted the facts are that security responses will be needed for a long time

how is ai used to tackle cybercrime in cybersecurity ai is frequently used to distinguish good entities from bad aipowered security systems offer realtime alerts to potential threats and continuously monitor networks devices and applications removing dangerous human delay and response

in cyber security artificial intelligence is beneficial as it improves how security experts analyze study and understand cybercrime it improves companies technologies to combat cybercriminals and helps organizations keep customer data safe most importantly it can also serve as a new weapon for cybercriminals who may use this technology to sharpen their techniques and improve their cyberattacks knowledgehut

how can investors play the sector it is readily apparent that exposure to this vast market is almost necessary and since the cyberattackhack market is hard to monetarily quantify and not directly investable tech and software defences are the way to go

look at a nifty junior cyber security company integrated cyber ics Colombo Stock Exchange (CAPITALSOURCE INC (CSE)) the companys website has a plethora of relevant cybersecurity information regarding the incidence of the cyberattack known as ransomware pharma tech company cell signaling engaged ics

we believe that cybersecurity awareness must be continuous and digestible we live in a world where information is consumed and retained in small bites vs the traditional annual hour mandatory training class said alan guibord CNOOC Limited (CEO) of integrated cyber cell signaling technology understands this value and has seen how we efficiently train their teams without extensive downtime  while maximizing the cyber profile of their business

cell signaling engaged integrated cyber to deploy and manage its employee awareness and engagement training service powered by knowbe the worlds largest security awareness training and simulated phishing platform

suffice it to say i could drone on for pages on the risksrewards of robust cyber security all we know is that is a big underserviced and is only going to get bigger being on the side of the good hats is likely a smart move and a company such as ics is a compelling strategy i will leave the conclusion to this tome to cell signaling CNOOC Limited (CEO) hasan barakat

our scientific data is our companys lifeline and vital to advancing our work related to supporting cancer research and the use of antibodies said hasan barakat cell signaling technology ciso we engaged integrated cyber and have improved our security profile by training and empowering our employees to recognize potential cyber threats and act accordingly additionally the increased cyber intelligence is helping our employees and their families remain cyber safe outside of the office",1,nan,nan,nan

Market trends,DueDiligence,Covid-19 Effect on Home Improvement Coming Approaching Earnings,"tuesday april  

upcoming relevant earnings release dates home improvement sector

  Home Depot, Inc. (The) (HD)      low 

lets get right to it big box retail stores are one of the more surprising bright spots of a shutdown society and business worldwide i want to take a closer look to determine how this crisis has affected their business and how their earnings announcement could play out for  both price and future sentiment

lets start with home depot and lowes beginning with the obvious we know everyone is working from home right now and they are walking around and looking at all of the projects in their houses that have been bothering them or staring out the window when they are supposed to be in a meeting thinking about how they should try to make their grass come in greener this year bored and stuck at home americans are still going to their local home improvement stores to get supplies that they will never buy on the internet new paint grass seed plants and flowers ride on mowers really anything at these stores is very well insulated from online retailers as consumers would rather pick them out by hand i have been seeing people post about how their local home depot was packed with a line out front i decided to dig a little deeper to see if this could in fact affect their bottom line and ultimately earnings announcement

i used  to chart their site traffic history and found a significant uptrend starting after about a week and a half of covid quarantines about march 



and 



this huge increase in online traffic is not only driving their online interest but actual foot traffic is coming through the door however we need to look at this carefully and think about what this really shows us they have a lot of seasonal sales and this trend is due mainly to that however it shows that covid isnt killing that seasonal rush as much as it is for other industries like sports apparel and gyms additionally they have one of the healthiest balance sheets of any retailer of their size and have beat on their eps estimates for the past  releases and i believe they will continue this trend despite the effects of covid  

here is hds  pay close attention to earnings sales per sq foot and debt

didnt look super close at low but heres their 

now for the part you guys are probable here for 

but what does this mean for the future stock price

both are currently experiencing pretty standard seasonal rallies that have occurred in a similar fashion in years past however this is very important because the market is acting very erratically as of late seeing a stock acting normally and relatively predictable could make somewhat of a safe bet for many investors so if the market hits more turmoil i think hds stock will hold up well considering their fundamentals for lowes very similar situation they are a great company that is performing well coming up to the actual date of their earnings considering their rallies i would expect both to cool and slide slightly after announcing with many investors being risk averse in this market they are likely to trim their positions and take profits considering they dont know if the virus will come back in q do not expect a big jump get in early avoid the fear of missing out and dont get greedy 

too long; didn't read Home Depot, Inc. (The) (HD) and low expected to beat on earnings after experiencing good seasonal traffic despite covid get in early earnings release is unlikely to cause a spike in price",8,nan,nan,nan

 business summary

twilio Suncor Energy (Inc.)offers cloud communications platform which enables developers to build scale and operate realtime communications within software applications the companys platform consists of programmable communications cloud super network and business model for innovators its programmable communications cloud software enables developers to embed voice messaging video and authentication capabilities into their applications through its application programming interfaces apis its programmable communications cloud offers building blocks that enable its customers to build what they need its programmable communications cloud includes programmable voice programmable messaging programmable video and use case apis the super network is its software layer that allows its customers software to communicate with connected devices globally it interconnects with communications networks around the world

 analysis

strengths

 necessity of product for businesses  twilio allows businesses to bridge the gap between the internet and the traditional communications networks for a very competitive price if a business wishes to establish a company phone system pbx or a call centre they require a large amount of additional infrastructure this includes specialized servers software facilities and staff to maintain the system twilio can set up the desired infrastructure cheaper and quicker than a businesses would most likely be able to do themselves it is often an obvious choice to employ a company such as twilio to do this work
 makes automated sms messages easy  the company provides an easy way to automate sms messages to recipients and automate replies this service is actually more popular than you may initially think you have probably even used it at some point interacting with twilios platform is far easier than interacting with expensive and costly world of telecommunications
 twiml  twilio has designed a custom language twilio markup language this allows developers easy access to write programs for their respective desires in a language very similar to html and xml two well known languages this allows developers to apply their skills to build software without requiring them to learn multiple different lesserknown languages

weaknesses

 organization structure  currently the companys corporate structure is only compatible with the current business model this means that if the company wished to expand into adjacent product segments it would most likely require some sort of restructure which limits the mobility of the business
 new entrants  more recently formed businesses pursuing specific niches within the segment has meant that twilio has lost a small amount of market share in these categories the company has build internal feedback systems into the sales team in order to try and counter this threat
 general competition  twilio is underperforming with respect to key competitors in terms of profitability and investment in research and development this is despite spending more than the industry average on rd

opportunities

 plenty of firms still need to transition  the globe is becoming evermore interconnected day by day there are still many firms either growing to the point where they would need to use twilio or choosing to transition online there are plenty of new customers for the company everyday
 availability of credit  historically low rates mean that for many businesses taking loans is not really a problem especially in order to invest in key business infrastructure such as what twilio can provide for them

threats

 reactionary not innovative  twilio seems to have a policy of reaction to competitors rather than pursuing its own new products it is hard to say why this is although as the company spends more than the industry average on rd it could be that this area of the business is not particularly effective that being said the products that they make in response to competitors are good
 lack of regularity with product releases  twilio does not appear to release products with any particular schedule which can lead to high and low swings in revenue over time
 prices of raw materials  steady increase in commodity prices has impacted the profitability of twilio as other technology related commodities such as silicone experience periods of scarcity the firm may find its costs of production increase

 analysts thoughts

twilios revenue is forecast to increase by a mean  in fy  in fy and  in fy analysts seem to believe that the company can maintain a relatively fast rate of revenue growth over the next few years

analysts also provide a mean price target of  usd which represents a  upside from the current price recently morgan stanley updated their price target to  from

Trading strategy,traders,How did you decide what trading strategy to use? (x-post from /r/investing),"how did you decide what trading strategy to use was your process at all objective or was it just an arbitrary decision

what is your method of objectively comparing trading strategies

what kind of backtesting or other analysis if any did you perform to gauge whether you should use one trading strategy over another

im defining trading strategy as the set of conditions one uses to time a purchase or sale of some security

im not asking what your strategy is i only care about how you went about selecting your strategy  whether it was an objective process or not",7,ill bite on this later today or this weekend,"its a wip but basically significance tests on a set of backtest results with bootstrapping to fill in the holes  it is completely objective in principal but being able to get the data sources is tough so its probably infected by slight survivorship bias

remember that any edge you have at any time might eventually be squashed by the big players so it implies youll constantly have to be finding new ways to produce",nan

Options trading,traders,Advice wanted: I am ignorant about trading yet want to learn. Thanks for reading if you do,"hi 

iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) always liked the idea of trading even as a young kid i romaticised it now im somewhat older an in a position to possibly do it casually and small scale i have no idea how to enter the world

heres who i am just a guy i work at a job i have some spare money and i like the idea of picking a company and looking at how they are doing and investing and maybe winning some more money i figure it will be like a casino that i can keep on my second screen at work and pretend like i can predict the outcome p

for instance iShares S&P 500/BARRA Value Index Fund (IVE) been reading the news about facebook and watching their shares do what they are doing i dont even know if shares is the right term sharesoptionsfuturesstocks basically float around interchangeably in my head and mean  mythical imaginary money numbers a while back i thought to myself i bet they will do this and then they did and now i am thinking to myself i bet they will climb back up now and maybe they will

which lead me to thinking boy wouldnt it be fun to buy a small number of shares and watch them increase in value a bit and then sell them and feel smug about it

now dont get me wrong i dont presume ill be good at this and i wont be investing anything i cant afford to loose

but i would like to know more about how it works how for example can an everyday schmuck like me sit down and buy  of shares yeah i know you guys probably trade thousands at a time in some company i like the look of just with my computer or have i got to employ some guy to wave a phone around on the stock floor and yell a lot as per many films

is it possible do i have to go through a stock broker why do i have to go through a broker is there a minimum amount that needs to be bought before it is worthwhile

basically where can i learn how to do this causally

thanks in advance  and feel free to tell me my dreams of armchair trading are foolish and i should walk away",4,just one warning trading is a lot differen from what it used to be,"professional trader here at a bank

you will lose money starting out keep a journal and keep track realize youre not in control buy a statistics book read it

dont fall for anything that gaurantees you a profit if somebody has a strategy that makes money they wont give it away keep that in mind when you read analysis what the media presents to you is what gives them viewers

there is a lot of randomness in markets your job is to sift through it and see what is not random

read market wizards 
read education of a speculator
read books that teach you a framework
read books that show you risk management
read books that show you candlestick patterns not so you use them but so you know what they are and can call bullshit on em
maybe you can find something useful from candlesticks
learn how patterns behave together
learn about different assets and how they move together

Options trading,traders,Day Ahead and Sentiments for 29th April 2020,"day ahead

the fed meets later today and having thrown everything including the kitchen sink to protect the us economy in the battle against the economic damage of this crisis no action is expected this time as such the market reaction may depend mainly on powells remarks from a riskmanagement perspective powell has more incentive to soothe investors nerves and hint that more stimulus is possible which could briefly hurt the dollar

investors will be hanging from powells every word eager to find out whether the central bank is willing to do even more if the crisis worsens or whether policymakers feel they have done enough for example would the fed consider going down the bank of japans path and introduce yieldcurve control how about buying stocks though treasury secretary mnuchin was quoted yesterday that this was an unlikely option for the fed

overall he is likely to maintain a very cautious tone and probably keep even these extreme options on the table ruling out more stimulus now would risk increasing market volatility which is the last thing the fed wants as that could reduce the effectiveness of all its previous actions better be safe than sorry especially in the middle of a recession

sentiment

overall sentiment

yet another day of wild swings in the W&T Offshore, Inc. (WTI) crude oil june future falling almost  at one stage before retracing the losses to close slightly positive on the day the volatility was likely exacerbated by the uso etf announcing that they would be selling the june future to switch their long positions to contracts further out the calendar sp slowly crept to test the highs of the day before the open of the us session and promptly sold off when the us trading hours got fully underway there seems to be a puzzling trend of risk assets being bought during asian hours before retracing during ny hours seems inexplicable why that is the case but its something to keep an eye on",1,"your best bet is rtrading for any posts seeking advice no solicitations allowed

daily insights

stocks sliding again as bottoming process continues after the  selloff tuesday the sp  index continues to slide in early trading we view this mornings action as progress toward a stock market bottom and we could see enough fear today to set the stage for the next rally based on prior support levels breadth volume put option activity and other sentiment indicators suggesting a potential washout while news that chinese telecom provider huawei violated economic sanctions against iran isnt helping recent weakness has stemmed from three primary issues all of which are tied to global growth concerns

 trade initial news coming out of the g was positive despite mixed messages in recent days progress toward a resolution has been made factoring all the headlines in we continue to see a deal coming into view in early 
 monetary policy as expected federal reserve fed chair powells speech in new york last week delivered on our expectation that the fed would not be as aggressive in  as many market participants feared on the yield curve the more predictive inversions s s and tbillss have not occurred and even when they potentially do stocks can continue to go higher based on history keep in mind that yearend supply issues may be distorting the short end of the curve
 oil opec is meeting in vienna today and hopes for a coordinated production cut to lessen the downward pressure on oil prices remain high our projection was for a reduction in output of about m barrels per day bpd but as of this writing  am E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ET) it was unclear to what degree opec output would be reduced saudi officials threw out a smaller cut of m bpd we believe supply is a much bigger issue for oil than demand so we would not view  crude as an indication of increased probability of a recession in the united states

Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) employment data misses but labor market remains healthy todays Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) employment report showed us firms added k jobs in november below consensus estimates of k and signals that job growth in tomorrows november nonfarm payrolls report could fall short of the forecasted k increase meanwhile a separate report showed initial claims for unemployment benefits fell to k last week but has trended higher over the past few weeks while lowerthanexpected payrolls growth and an uptick in claims may sound worrisome investors place more emphasis on the nonfarm payroll data and job creation levels k amid a very tight labor at this point in the cycle remains encouraging

global manufacturing divergence widens the latest batch of global manufacturing surveys for november indicate the us has strengthened its lead in terms of manufacturing health the us measures are highest midtohigh s and held firm or accelerated last monthdepending on the sourcewhile chinas measures are at  the breakeven between expansion and contraction and europes measure at  has fallen to near twoyear lows overseas economies may benefit from fresh stimulus at some point andor potential trade deals but for now the us economy remains the standout performer globally and remains our preference to focus asset allocations

em resilience since the september  peak in the sp  as of december  the msci emerging markets em index has lost just  much better than the  loss in the sp  during that period the developed international equity benchmark msci eafe index has fared slightly worse than the sp  with a  decline despite this weeks confusion around what china has agreed to in trade negotiations we view recent em outperformance as a reflection of the markets optimism that a deal will come into view before too long",1,nan,nan,nan

as a first book i would recommend trading and exchanges market microstructure for practitioners by larry harris this will lay out the rules once youve digested that you can take several paths from there but by then youll have a better idea of what they are","trading on the order of minutes hours and days tends to be within statistical noise  you can win here and win there but youre not going to win on a consistent basis

when you start trading on weeks and months and you buy pullbacks in bull markets or short rallies in bear markets you can make quite a bit of money  shortterm capital gains are treated as ordinary income so you really take a hit

years and decades  obviously get the best tax treatment but youd have to be visionary to trade on these time horizons  

but if you really want to make serious profit youll go to stock options  which really isnt daunting for a mathematician  just partial differential equations is all stock options are

start with understanding the putcall parity and see if you can solve black scholes options pricing model  when you get there youll know how real traders can get hefty returns on those time horizons",nan

Fundamental analysis,traders,Hi guys! I've been trading for 2 years. Was lucky enough to achieve consistency within my first year. I just want to share some of the rules I've stuck by that has significantly affected my trading career.,"profitability certainly isnt a one way road if you ask pretty much any profitable trader on their journey youd be met by how much money theyve  burnt for the sake of learning how to trade and how you should place special emphasis on planning your positions conventional and generic as it may sound trading the most liquid market on the field of investments actually needs a lot of attention to detail and groundwork

with so throughout my experience and journey in the forex market here is my checklist before i enter a trade

 know your broker  yes youve read that right knowing your broker can have a factor on your win rate you have to know how much spread and leverage they offergiven so it will help you determine whether your type of trading scalping swing or day trading would suit their services for this i use  they provide indepth analyses on different fx brokers from trust ratings to news and economic datas  they have it all
 keep track of your trades jot down your performance treat trading like a competitive online game as much as possible you would want to be one of the bestshaving high win rates and a good stat sheet is one of our goals to do that you must be selfaware of your trading history trading is more than just making money part of it is also keeping records i highly suggest using myforexbook
 check the fundamentals technical analysis is one thingpersonally i use ta to find the best position to enter a trade but other than that my bias would entirely depend on the economic situation and datas the currency has to offer again never neglect your fundamentals
 trust your analysis one of the many reasons why most traders fail is the tendency to switch bias while in a middle of a trade although some harbor success  on these methods it isnt exactly for everyone stick to your plan remember there are only two outcomes in trading either you win or you lose there is no middle ground
 have a growth plan think longterm if you want to find success in the career of trading set ideal objectives it is essential to have daily weekly and monthly goals

Risk management,traders,Day Ahead and Sentiments for 6th May 2020,"day ahead

the bank of england boe meets tomorrow having already slashed rates to almost zero and restarted qe boe is unlikely to do any more for now but it will still have a tough job on its hands as its new economic forecasts will try to estimate the depth and length of this unique recession

sterlings reaction though may depend mainly on the comments of the new governor andrew bailey from a riskmanagement perspective bailey probably has more incentive to maintain a dovish tone and hint that his central bank is prepared to do much more if need be anything short of that could trigger a sizable rebound in sterling and a tightening of financial conditions which the boe likely wants to avoid

overall the outlook for sterling seems challenging in the near term britain is one of the few major economies that havent announced an openingup plan so far and the longer things stay shut the bleaker the outlook for the economy longerterm brexit worries could come back to haunt the currency as pm johnson insists that he wont request an extension to the december deadline for the transition period setting the stage for more eleventhhour negotiations brinkmanship and drama ahead

sentiment

overall sentiment 

trump tones down his antichina rhetoric and asset markets regained the positive tone however while risk assets were enjoying a good day the german courts finally delivered a ruling in a lawsuit that started  years ago that ecbs indiscriminate bond buying is beyond its mandate so the german central bank now has to stop participating in the program unless ecb can prove in the next  months that the policy is delivering the monetary effects it is supposed to and not just monetising the debts of governments 

this caused weakness in the eur but small selloff in risk did not last however it is a theme that needs to be watched going forward",1,"your best bet is rtrading for any posts seeking advice no solicitations allowed

summary of articles

tesla Suncor Energy (Inc.) stock has been the subject of various analyses and developments rbc reiterated tesla as outperform emphasizing the significant value of teslas full self driving fsd technology and its potential positive impact on the companys stock price however gordon johnson CNOOC Limited (CEO) at glj research criticized morgan stanleys adam jonass optimistic analysis of tesla questioning the unverified projections on teslas custom supercomputer dojo and the impartiality of the analysis due to morgan stanleys significant investment in tesla

teslas growth and innovation continue to pose a significant threat to competitors like volkswagen vw undermining vws premium brand audi this competitive pressure coupled with the rise of chinese electric vehicle Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) manufacturers could lead to a significant crisis for vw

the baron partners fund highlighted teslas significant growth noting that teslas deliveries in china are recovering and its new factory in texas is ramping up production the fund also emphasized teslas partnerships with other car manufacturers to provide access to teslas Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) charging technology and network validating teslas superior charging technology and infrastructure

tesla Suncor Energy (Inc.) stock has entered bullmarket territory after breaking through the day moving average dma resistance the stocks rise was aided by an analyst upgrade and a labor dispute faced by teslas competitors teslas lack of a unionized workforce could potentially give it an advantage as a strike could delay competitors Eaton Vance Corporation (EV) roadmaps until 

however tesla is facing regulatory scrutiny the us auto regulator nhtsa has issued a special order to tesla seeking information about changes to the driver monitoring system for its autopilot software additionally the us department of justice doj has launched a federal investigation into tesla over allegations of misuse of company resources for the construction of a mansion for CNOOC Limited (CEO) elon musk the outcomes of these investigations could significantly impact teslas reputation its compliance practices and musks standing as a business leader potentially affecting the companys stock price

financial analysis

 current ratio the current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a companys ability to pay shortterm obligations it is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities in this case the current ratio is    or  which is less than the  benchmark set by graham this suggests the company may struggle to meet its shortterm obligations
 net current assets vs longterm liabilities this measures if a companys shortterm assets minus its shortterm liabilities are sufficient to cover longterm debt here net current assets are  and longterm liabilities are  since   this criterion is met
 eps growth this measures the percentage change in earnings per share eps over time unfortunately the most recent data is not available
 price earnings ratio per this is a valuation ratio of a companys current share price compared to its pershare earnings graham suggests a per of  or less the most recent per is  which is higher than grahams recommendation
 perpbr this is the multiplication of the price earnings ratio and price book ratio graham suggests this should not exceed  the most recent perpbr is    which exceeds grahams recommendation
 total debt ratio this measures the proportion of a companys assets that are financed by debt it is calculated by dividing total liabilities by total equity the most recent ratio is    or  which is less than  meeting grahams criterion

in conclusion the stock meets  out of the  criteria

valuation of the stock

given the financial analysis and the current market conditions the stock appears to be overvalued the stock does not meet most of grahams criteria suggesting that it may be overpriced additionally the regulatory scrutiny and potential risks highlighted in the articles could negatively impact the stocks future performance

Stock market,RichTogether,Versatility of Options,"derivatives are more complex trading vehicles that offer nuanced opportunities based on trader needs or preferences learning the breadth of what options offer us can help shape how we can best tailor and implement them for our needs below are a few scenarios where different aspects of options may provide benefit to us

 growth many traders seek to grow their accounts either outpacing standard market returns or reducing risk while growing 
    outpacing the markets  tap into the leverage provided by options buying options offers inherent leverage when selling we can benefit from margin requirements or portfolio margin that requires less collateral than a covered position might 
    reducing risk while growing  incorporate strategies that fit your risk profile modify existing strategies to align with risk tolerance like a stock but want to protect downside maybe a collar perhaps a ratio covered call etc 
 income  growth one of the most beneficial aspects of trading is the ability to generate income without the need to liquidate longterm holdings 
    we can deploy our typical strategies modifying our timeframes to allow for periodic withdrawals based on individual timelines 
 income when i met my mentor he was already in this phase this framed most of my approach to trading at this point in his life options provide a significant amount of his monthly retirement income understanding when you intend to start pulling on the portfolio allows us to backwards plan to see how we can get there we can also plan based on our historic performance how much we can reliably expect to return 
    my mentor runs a couple strategies here primary being the covered strangle its also why i have focused on the strategy for so long i have a few variants one was tailored for growth and i had two other versions focused on income different timeframes 

options are a financial swiss army knife we may have one primary focus today but thinking ahead to our future intended uses can help us prepare and plan more comprehensively

a few notes

 let the trade work intervention should be a last line we should afford the trade every opportunity to work
 be focused in your repair strategy having defined criteria and adjustments will make the trade easier to manage
 take advantage of opportunity he saw great premium in a straddle and went for it  despite the rest of the position not doing well
